Councillor Baker wondered in dealing with grants, whether it be provincial or
federal, if they take into effect how many have been awarded to a
community. He asked if it would weigh negatively on the City if we received
too many grants. Dave Paul replied that it would depend on what program
and government body was being applied to,

Councillor Kalivas would like more information on exactly what staff's
commitment would be for this project. Bob Casselman agreed that he will
get that information prepared for the Council meeting next week.

Notice of Motion
Establishment of a Water Advisory Committee
(Councillor Baker)

Moved by: Councillor Baker

THAT the Committee support the establishment of a Water Advisory
Committee with the Terms of Reference to be developed.

CARRIED

Councillor Baker introduced his motion saying that status quo is inadequate.
He would like to see what the big water users in industry have to say.

Mayor Henderson is not in favour of such a committee as it is the
responsibility of staff and Council to ensure that Brockville is provided clean
drinking water. He added that perhaps the Drinking Water Quality
Management System could be enhanced to include other members of Council
and possibly members of the public.
