Signage at Suzanna Land. Will the city assume responsibility for more
efficient signage?

What measures will the city undertake to ensure our private, tiny
development isn't further overwhelmed? Reference to traffic on’ King
Street.

How wil the city manage traffic challenges where entry and exit meet King
Street?

How will the city manage parking overflow?

9. Neighbour

How can consent to sever and re-zone the Cable Property be granted on
‘August 24”, when the public meeting is not scheduled until September
4° (Am | to presume that the decision to sever the property in question
and the zoning to “Institutional Area’ is not subject to public discussion?)
How does the City propose to reduce the expected noise resulting from
the proposed site configuration, to minimize the impact on adjacent
residents? Significant property easements? Buffer zone? Trees and
shrubbery plantings? Fencing?

How can the City minimize the impact of increased trafic on the already-
busy King Street? Restrictive access roads? Turing zones? No left turn?
Trafic lights? Speed bumps on King Street andlor on the access road(s)
to the new facilities and parking areas?

Will all the trees on the affected areas be cut down: both the huge, old
codars currenty along King Street (that act as a tratfic noise buffer for
local residents, as well as homes for thousands of birds, squires, etc)
and the old maples and other deciduous trees further in on the Cable
Property? Wil all or some of, the beautiful wilows at the north end of the
property also be affected?

What willbe done to facilitate better drainage of the severed property (550,
King Street West) that will alleviate the risk of flooding and the continuing
erosion of our properties on the west side of the Cable property?

HiJon,

Ws been @ while. Hope you've been keeping well

‘While we realise the three notices we received in the mail on August 13th and [4th are preliminary, we have the
following questions. Dayna suggested you'd prefer to have these in advance to our meeting.

4) Given all the land available, why the need to seek relief from the 153 mandated number of parking
spaces? Where wil parking overflow be directed in the case of school or sport events?

4) Ifthe sports field remains to the east of Susanna Lane, will the school board erect a fence separating our
property ftom theirs?

'5) Will bleachers around the field be erected?
{6 1 as told by parents volunteering on boards of sports teams that they will be using the field during the
‘evenings and on summer days, With this in mind, will the school board build and maintain toilets? Who will
empty out the trash cans?

7) When is construction ofthe schoo! slated to stert and how long is it expected to last?

Jn regards to the culvert on Juni's land bordering Susansa Lane's northern and eastern perimetre:

1) Will the purchase of the land by the schoo! board put an end to the dispute over the the culvert, given that
re now before the courts?

1) Since Susanna Lane's inception, we've experienced drivers entering our lane, believing it tobe a back road to
CCentre-—even though we paid early on to have it signed as private, Would the city assume responsibility for
more efficient signage?

2) We believed-—-mistakenly it now soems-—that the introduction of bike lanes and reduction of four lanes on
King Street West dawn to two would calm traffic ftom Cede to the Country Club, All residents here have
experienced a worsening of road rage: drivers passing aggressively in the centre tum lane, impatient drivers
tailgating us a8 we ty to slow down going west totum in, and problems with speeding drivers so i's hard for us
toexit onto King, What measures will the city undertake to ensure our privat, tiny development in‘ further
overwhelmed?

13) Overall, how will the city manage traffic challenges where entry and exit meet King street?

4) Overall, how will the city manage parking overflow? Will the city allow parking on King Street West for
special events? Right now, Junie’ land is being used as traffic overflow for many St. Lawrence Park events,
boaters with trailers, cars perked by che two private garages on King, illegal campers who are too cheap to pay
to camp at St. Lawrence Pack, dog owners running their animals without picking up their poop, ete. Where will
all these vehicles go?

Looking forward to seeing you

Inform you that donot understand the curenty published plans forthe aforementioned property at
‘550 King Street West, and have several concerns about the intended use ofthe severed property. After
seeing the Notices fom the City Clerk and the Panning Departmentn the Recorder & Times on August
9, 2038, [subsequently recelved copies of there documents sent from the City by mall rectly tome.
But theve notices are undear and not consistent. {algo recelved additional information at a meeting |
requested with Jonathan Faurschou ofthe Cit’ Planning Department, on August 15, 2018

‘asia the descriptions provided Inthe City's documentation are non-specii the descriptions vary
‘rom document to document, and they are only stated in “assessment and zoning speak—nothing
loca resident can rete to or understand. On the proposed severance document our small enclave of
townhouses at the corner of King and Cantre Streets isnot represented accurately on the incuded map,
and the roadways ajacent to the Cable Property, withthe exception of King treet, do not seen to
‘ppear a al (thy would be useful to clarity the boundaries of the property and the severance under
‘iscussion). There te aleo zero info concerning the locaton ofthe propased structures (elementary
schoo), double lee pads, parking, et) on the property in question, nor about the proposed easements

located? And what "butlers proposed between the school, the play-yard, parking, etc, tthe rear of

‘ny property? Lfel, cause ofthe location of my propery, | wil be creslv impacted by the curentty
planned development of the Cable Property lands.

Both the proposed elementary school {onthe west sde) and the twin ce pas (onthe eastside) wit
generate a significant increace in taffg on King Street, with much turing of schoo! buses, cars, tals,
‘te, King Streets slready heavily travelled, boing a main east-west artery into and out ofthe Cty asthe
‘municipal portion of Highway 2 along the St. Lawrence River. Last year the ity recognized the traffic
problems on King treet by reconfiguring the traffic lanes from fur lanes to two, providing a centre left-
turing lane (currently used by many drivers a¢ a passing lane, and not exreerty pollcd adequately),
and incl bloyee lanes on both sides going east and west. The current configuration is definitely an
improvement, in many ~ but not all cases; the trafic on King Street has slowed with the exception of
rmotorocles, school buses and cem-trck/trales whe continue to consider the stretch across the Cable
Property (and beside St. Lwrence Pack) asa straightaway for acceleration!

Danage ofthe Cable Property has always been a problem since the housing construction on the west
‘se began in 2008, An open ditch stretches the fll length behind the houses builton the eas side of
‘Susanna Lane and all long the eastside of Contre Street. A huge surface draln fs located beh

+ How can consent to sever and re-zone the Cable Property be granted on

‘+ How can the City minimize the impact of increased traffic on the already.

‘+ Will all the trees on the affected areas be cut down: both the huge, old

local residents, as well as homes for thousands of birds, squirels, etc.)
and the old maples and other deciduous trees further in on the Cable
Property? Will all or some of, the beautiful villows at the north end of the

‘The Site has an industrial history dating from 1922 when a large manufacturing plant (Philips Cable
Facility) occupied the site. The manufacturing facility was demolished in 2008 followed by an
environmental remediation pregram. In 2010, a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was
Lndertaken by Paterson Group. This Phase II ESA concluded thatthe bulk of impacted soll had been
appropriately removed and disposed of. A record of site condition (RSC) was file on the
Environmental Site Registry in 2010,

2.2.1 PUBLIC AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

‘The Site is well serviced by Brockvile Transits Red Bus line, as shown in Figure 2-6. The Red Bus tne
runs every half-hour from 7 am to 6 pm, Monday to Friday, along King Street West and provides
service to the Central Business District. Stops are located along King Street West, atthe corer of King
Street West and Centre Stroet and west ofthe Site at Centre Street and Baxter Drive.

3 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

“The Upper Canada District School Board (UCDSB) is proposing to construct a 1-storey elementary
school for unior kindergarten to grade 6, onthe Site. The proposed school consists of 22 classrooms, a
‘gymnasium, muli-purpose area, staff facities, and an outdoor sports field, The UCDSB"'s proposal is
coordinated witha "win pad’ recreational development by the City of Brockville tothe east of the
proposed elementary school

In September 2018, facing decining elementary school enrollments between 2005 and 2016, the
LUCDSB initiated a Pupil Accommodation Review, as per UCDSB Policy 418, This review was based on
{an analysis ofa full ange of factors including enrolment, space utiization, French language instruction,
capture rate and facility collaboration, and included extensive community consultation.

(On March 23, 2017, the UCDSB Board of Trustees voted to approve the recommendations in “Building
for Our Future” Pupil Accommodation Review Final Staff Report. This included the recommendation
that Toniata P.S, and Commonwealth P.S. (with Prince of Wales P.S.) be consolidated ata future date
to be determined pending Ministry approval fora new Brockvle elementary school. On August 4, 2017,
$10,852,080 of funding was confirmed by the Province of Ontario for a new elementary school in
;Brockvile, permiting the UCDSB to proceed withthe needed facilty.

‘The proposed elementary school wil include a chikicae facility, which wil operate year-round,
‘Additionally, the schoo's sports field and gymnasium will be made available for community use.

‘The Schematic Layout, prepared by Architecture49 Inc, dated July 10, 2018, shows a school bus drop-
cffpleup area and parking lot onsite, as shown in Figure 3-1. The parking lot is comprised of 73
vehicle parking spaces. Bicycle parking willbe provided in accordance with the City of Brockvilie's
‘Comprehensive Zoning By-law 050-2014,

‘The Site's parking area and school bus drop-ofipick-up area willbe accessed from King Street West by
way of a new publi right-of-way (ROW) which will also serve the proposed City “twin pad” recreation
area parking lot, as shown in Figure 3-1, According to @ Functional Servicing Report dated July 27,
2018, prepared by WSP, the new ROW Is proposed to be approximately 21m wide. Turing lanes wall
be provided on King Street West to access the proposed new ROW from the south. Turing lanes will
also be provided within the new ROW for southbound vehicles exiting the Site onto King Street West
‘The ROW is also anticipated to service future development north ofthe Site.

‘The new elementary schoo! is anticipated to be operational by September 2022 and is expected to
‘accommodate 500 pupils not including childcare. The proposed schools illustrated in Figure 3-2 and
Figure 33.

4 POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

‘This section describes the local and provincial policy framework that is relevant or applicable tothe
proposed development of the sie.

4 PROVINCIAL POLICY STATEMENT (2014)

‘The 2014 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) provides policy crection on matters of provincial interest
‘elated to land use planning and development. AS a key part of Ontario's policy-led planning system,
the PPS sets the policy foundation for regulating development and use of land.
‘The PPS seeks to strike a balance between the province's economic, social and environmental
Interests through the folowing:

‘+ Promoting costoffective development patterns which stimulate economic growth;

‘+ Protecting resources for thelr economic use andlor environmental benefits and

+ Directing development away from areas where there Isa risk to public heath and safety or of

property damage.

EFFICIENT AND RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE PATTERNS
‘The Provincial Polcy Statement states that healthy, livable and safe communities ae sustained by
‘accommodating an appropriate range and mix of uses including institutional uses to meet long-term.
needs.
Under Section 1.1 Managing and Directing Land Use to Achieve Efficient and Resilient Development
‘and Land Use Patterns, Policy 1.1.1 b. Policy 1.1.1 g. states that healthy, veable and safe
‘communities are sustained by ensuring that necessary public service facies are or will be available to
meet current and projected needs. Public service facies are defined as land, buildings and structures
{or the provision of programs and services provided or subsidized by a government or other body, such
‘as health and educational programs.
Planning authories are directed to promote economic development and competitiveness by providing
for an appropriate mix and range of employment and institutional uses to meet long-term needs
(emphasis added), under Section 1.3 Employment, Policy 1.3.4 a
‘SETTLEMENT AREAS
‘Settlement Areas are intended tobe the focus of growth under Section 1.1.3 Settlement Areas, and
Policy 1.1.2.1 drects that the vitality and regeneration of Settlement Areas shall be promoted. Policy
4.4.23 states that Planning authorities shall identify appropriate locations and promote opportunities
for intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated, including brownfield sites, and
the availabilty of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facies,

See a nde an nt yw Amante ets “~
se roe

Page 57 of 100

ENERGY CONSERVATION, AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Planning authorities shall support energy conservation and efficiency, improved air quality, reduced
greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change adaptation through land use and development patterns
hich promote the use of active transportation and transit in and between residential, employment
(including commercial and industrial) and institutional uses and other areas, according to Section 1.8
Energy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change, Policy 1.8.1 . Active transportation is also
highlighted in Section 1.1.3 Settlement Areas, Policy 1.1.32, which states that land use patterns in
settlement areas shall be based on mixes of land uses which support active transportation

‘The proposed development is consistent with the PPS as it ensures the provision of a
necessary public service facility, as supported by Policy 1.4.1 g. The proposed location of the
‘new school on vacant land within Brockville's Urban Area (Settlement Area) is consistent with
the direction of the PPS to encourage the vitality of settlement areas, promote efficient
development patterns, encourage active transportation, and conserve natural resources.

42 CITY OF BROCKVILLE OFFICIAL PLAN (2012)

‘The City of Brockvile Oficial Plan (OP) establishes the criteria for evaluating proposals for change and
‘growth, based on a policy-led system that focuses on long-term goal, targets and objectives. The OP
‘sets out a 20-year growth management regime fo the City through to 2031. The Site is located within
the urban boundary (i. settlement area) and is designated Neighbouhood Development Area on
‘Schedule 1 City Structure. Part of the Site is also within the Mixed Use Corridor, as ilustrated in Figure
44.

422 STRATEGIC PLANNING THEMES AND GROWTH MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Brockville's four strategic planning themes, outlined in Section 2.3 The Ciy’s Planning Goals and
‘Objectives, offer a broad framework for evaluating grovah:

‘+ Theme 1: A Sustainable, Healthy and Vital City;

‘+ Theme 2: An Economically Strong and Diverse City;

+ Thome 3: High Qualty of City Services and Amenities; and
‘+ Theme 4: WellPlanned and Responsive Cty.

\Within these four themes, the OP sets out objectives relating to development and growth management.
‘The proposed development responds to objectives listed in Table 4-1

In addition to the objectives discussed above, Policy 3.2.3.1 under Section 3.2.3 ~The Citys Urban
‘Area directs that the Urban Area (Le. Settlement Area) is to be the focus ofa broad range of uses
inchuding institutional uses. Policy 3 under the same section states that the City wil identify and
promote intensification, infil and redevelopment of vacant sites and areas in transtion inthe Urban
‘Area, The redevelopment ofthe ste, which is currenty vacant and was previously industrial and,
supports both ofthese policies.

‘Section 3.5.2 Community Facilties states thatthe City shall endeavour to provide adequate
‘community services and facitie to meet the needs ofthe City’s existing and future residents through
the provision of adequate opportunities for education, open space and recreation. Itis the policy ofthe
City, as per Polcy 3.5.2.1, that the need for now schools be idented in consultation with the School
Boards In 2017, the UCOSB completed the Pup Accommodation Review which identified the need for
‘anew school. The UCDSB is coordinating this development wit the City’s planned "win pad” arena,
‘optimizing the provision of community services on this Site

Addtionally, Section 35.3 ~ Recreation, Policy 3.5.3.6 state that the City shall promote integration of
recreational and open space uses with pedestrian and cycing linkages. The site isin proximity to the
‘Waterfront Tral Routo, the multi-use Brock Tail, and pedestrian infrastructure linking the site fo the
immediate neighbourhood as well as Brockile's downtown.

‘The proposed development conforms to the goals and objectives established in the City of
Brockville's Official Plan, The proposed development will be compatible with the existing
neighbourhood, will provide opportunities for recreation, and will represent re-development of a
‘vacant site. The site is strategically located with respect to active transportation networks (0.9.

42.3. LAND USE DESIGNATION
‘The Site is designated as Neighbourhood Development Area on Schedule 1 City Structure.
Neighbourhood Development Areas are intended to accommodate the majoty of new low and
‘medium-density residential development. They represent existing vacant, greenfield, and Brownfield
lands within the City that, overtime, are likely to develop as new residential and commercial uses
Section 4.4.2 ~ Permitted Uses permits a wide range of residential, neighbourhood commercial,
community, and accessory uses within the Neighbourhood Development Area. Policy 4.4.29 states
that “elementary schools and day care centres shall be permitted, subject tothe polices of Sections
443.28 and 44,3.28."

Policy 4.43.25 states that Community uses shall be subject tothe following ritoria

+ uso shall have direct access to an Arterial or Collector road;

+ the use shall have an overall site area of up to a maximum of 2 hectares;

+ the density, height and character of the development shall be compatible with adjacent uses;

‘+ the watermains and sanitary sewers shall be capable of accommodating the development, or
the proponent shall commit to upgrading services at no costo the City, save and except where
private septic systems shall be permited;

‘+ the development shall be designed and landscaped, and buffering shall be provided to ensure
that the visual impact of the development on adjacent uses is minimized;

‘+ all required perking shall be provided on the site, and cash-in-iew of required parking in
‘accordance with the policies of Section 6.2.4 ofthis Plan, shall not be accepted by the City; and

+ the use shall be subject to site pian contol, in accordance with the policies of Section 6.4.6 of
this Plan,

While the proposed elementary school conforms to most of the policies under Section 4.43.25, the
proposed site is 5.8 hectares and therefore does not conform to Poly 4.4.3.25 i, which limits the site
‘area of elementary schools to 2 hectares.

‘The site is proposed to be re-designated to institutional Area, as discussed in Section 5.2 ofthis
Report, to permit the proposed elementary school. Policies under OP Section 4.8 ~ Institutional Area.
rect institutional uses that are of a community or regional nature tothe Institutional Area

‘Tho proposed development does not conform to the Neighbourhood Development Area polic
of the Official Plan as the proposed site is over 2 hectares in size. As such, an Official Plan
‘Amenciment is required to re-designate the Site to Institutional Area. The proposed
development conforms to the policies of the Institutional Area designation, as discussed in
Section 5.2.


Page 62 of 100

4.24 MIXED USE CORRIDOR

‘A portion ofthe Site adjacent to king Street West is identified as being within the Mixed Use Corridor
‘area, as shown in Figure 4-1. Official Plan Section 3.2.2.1 ~ Mixed Use Nodes and Corridors describes
the Mixed Use Corridors, along with Nodes as “a framework to create opportunities fr intensification,
redevelopment and infll in a manner that willnot have a destabilzing effect on established
neighbourhoods." Additionally, this section notes that “development on lands linking the Coridors, as
llystrated on Schedule 1, is encouraged to be mixed use" and is intended to be of a density which is
transit supportive

‘The proposed development represents an opportunity for redevelopment and infil that will not have a
destabilizing effect on established neighbourhoods. However, the proposed elementary school, by its
nature, isnot mixed use and, while the Site Is well served by transit, does not represent what would
typically be considered “transit supportive” development

‘The proposed development does not conform to the intent of the Official Plan's Mixed Use
Corridor Area. As such, an Official Plan Amendment is required to permit the proposed
‘elementary school,

43 CITY OF BROCKVILLE COMPREHENSIVE ZONING BY-LAW 050-
20%

“The ste le zoned Holding Zone 1, Residential 4(H1-4R), as ilustrated in Figure 4-2. The Holding Zone
1 represents a Servicing Holding Zone, In order to lif this holding symbol, the Zoning By-taw requires
that servicing be avalable, or that Counc is satisfied that an appropriate servicing agreement is in
place to service the lands,
‘The Residential 4 Zone generally permits a range of residential building types and accessory uses. The
Residential 4 Zone, however, does not permit schools. “Schoof" is defined in Section 2.0 ofthe Zoning
Bylaw as:
“A bulging in which educational services are offered within the context of the elementary and
secondary curriculum of, or under chatter granted by, the Province of Ontario. A school shall not
inlude any other use as defined herein.”

To permit the proposed elementary schoo}, the subject lands are proposed to be re-zoned to
Institutional 1 with a special exception for parking.

444 SUMMARY OF PLANNING POLICY AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK

‘The proposed development is consistent with the PPS. The proposed institutional use / public

service facility is within a settlement area, utilizing land and existing infrastructure efficiently,

‘The proposed Consent represents an opportunity for development on vacant lands in the Urban Area.
The proposed Consent only creates one severed lot, Municipal services wil bein place to service the
proposed severed lot.

‘The proposed Consent to Sever has regard for the criteria outlined in Section 61(24) of the
Planning Act, including provincial interests. The proposed Consent conforms to the policies of
the City of Brockville’s Official Plan including considerations for road access, lot size, proper
development of adjacent lands, parkland dedication, and municipal services.

5.2 PROPOSED OFFICIAL PLAN AMENDMENT

‘The Sit is proposed tobe re-designated from Neighbourhood Development Area to Institutional Area
In the City’s Official Plan to permit the proposed elementary school. Additionally, the Site is proposed to
be removed from the “Mixed Use Corridor area, as shown on Schedule 1 of the Official Plan. A copy of
the Draft Official Pan Amendment can be found in Appendix A to this Report

Section 4.8~ Institutional Areas ofthe OP provides polices for Institutional Areas. Policy 4.8.2.1 states
{hatin the Institutional Area ‘major insttutional uses, such as hospitals, clinics and treatment facilities,
‘elementary schoo's, secondary schools, post-secondary educational facilites, government offices,
places of worship, cometeris, and govormment-operated institutions shal be permitted”

‘There is a strong rationale for this proposed Official Pian Amendment, both with reference to the
principles of good land use planning and the specific policies contained inthe City of Brockville Offical
Pian. In brief, these are:

‘Stet Sar ncaa an rn Aen ees
See" nat

Page 72 of 100

41) The Upper Canada Distict Schoo! Board has determined that a new elementary school facility
Is eritcal to serve the short and long-term interests of the city. The location proposed new
school meets a number of OP policies related to intensification and infil, compatibility with
existing uses, integration ofthe open space system, active transportation and public ransit
accessibilty

2) The change of designation through an Official Plan Amendment is necessary because the
proposed schoo! site is larger than the 2 ha. mit in the existing Neighbourhood Development
‘Area designation. The larger site size wil permit additional uttering ofthe school use and
‘associated parking from the established neighbourhoods around the site. The proposed
development is also more In keeping with the polices ofthe Institutional Area designation.

Landscaping details to both butler and integrate the development with the existing community
will be confirmed at the Site Plan Control stage.

3) Construction of a new facility to current accessibilty standards wil increase the facilites in
Brockvile that can serve those with disabilities and people ofall ages. This isan important
provision inthe Institutional designation which is proposed forthe Ste (OP Policy 4.8.3.8).

The proposed development supports the strategic goals and objectives of the OP and conforms
to the policies of the Institutional Area designation. The proposed development respects the
local character and context of the community while recognizing the planned function of the site
and the surrounding area. The site Is located In an urban settioment area where full municipal
‘services will be provided. Tho Site is serviced by public transit, and takes advantage of the
‘existing and proposed infrastructure in the area.

5.3 PROPOSED ZONING BY-LAW AMENDMENT
“The Site is proposed tobe re-zoned from Residential Zone 4to Institutional 1 — Special Exception (I1-
). While the 1-X zone will maintain the general intent ofthe Institutional 1 (11) Zone, a special
‘exception is needed to address parking requirements.

‘The general intent ofthe Institutional 1 (11) zone is to provide for a broad range of institutional uses.
‘The specific provisions ofthe It zone are outined in Tables 6-8 and 6-4, A copy of the Draft Zoning
By-law Amendment can be found in Appendix B to this Report.

‘Table 6-3 provides a detailed compliance chart demonstrating where the proposed development meets
the Zoning By-law provisions ofthe proposed I1 zone, with the exception of parking requirements,

‘Questions re. Development of 550 King Suet West (schoo, culver, twin pads and
‘overall trafic ow and parking)

HiJon,

is been a while. Hope you've been keeping well

‘While we realise the three notices we reeaived in the mail on August 13th and {4th are preliminary, we have the
following questions, Dayna suggested you'd prefer to have these in advance to our meeting.

In regards to the school and sports field
1) Where is the road forthe main entrance to the school?

2) Where will the school buses wait and pick up the children? Running diesel buses will bea concern.

3) Will the 75 parking spots back up close tothe east row of Susanna Lane?

4) Given all the land available, why the need to scek relief from the 153 mandated mumber of parking,
spaces? Where will parking overflow be directed in the case of school ar sport events?

4) Ifthe sports field remains to the east of Susanna Lane, wil the school board erecta fence separating our
property fom theirs?

5) Will bleachers around the field be erected?
6) I as told by parents volunteering on boards of sports teams that they will be using the field during the
evenings and on summer days, With this in mind, will the school board build and maintain toilets? Who will
empty out the trash cans?

‘7) When is construction ofthe school slated to start and how long sit expected to last?

{In regards to the culvert on Junic's land bordering Susana Lane's northem and easter perimetre:

‘Will the purchase ofthe land by the schoo! board put an end tothe dispute over the the culvert, given that
are now before the courts?

2) Once the school sup and running, wo wil be responsible fr maintaining the drainage pipe (which
replaces the culver: the ety or the school board?

In regards to the traffic flow and parking issues that will intensify because of the building ofthe
\, school/daycare/group centre with reduced parking, the twin pads, and two sports fields:


Page 97 of 100 |

1) Since Susanna Lane's inception, we've experienced drivers entering our lane, believing it to be a back road to
Centre-—even though we paid eatly on to have i signed as private. Would the eity assume responsibility for
more efficient signage?

2) We believed-—mistakenly t now scems-—that the introduction of bike lanes and reduction of four lanes on
King Stret West down to two would calm traffic from Cedar to the Country Club, All residents here have
‘experienced a worsening of road rage: drivers passing aggressively inthe centre turn lane, impatient drivers
tuilgsting us as we try to slow down going west totum i, and problems with speeding drivers so it's hard for us
tocxit onto King. What measures will the city undertake to ensure our private, tiny development isnt further
overwhelmed?

3) Overall, how will the city manage traffic challenges where entry and exit meet King street?

4) Overall, how will the ety manage parking overflow? Will te city allow parking on King Stret West for
special events? Right now, Junics land is being used as traffic overflow for many SI. Lawrence Park events,
boaters with trailers, cars parked by the two private garages on King, illegal campers who are too cheap to pay
toccamp at St. Lawrence Park, dog owners running their animals without picking up their poop, etc. Where will
all these vehicles go?

Jel be unable to attend the
scheduled meeting. Tm sure it will be wel attended.

Looking forward to seeing you.

‘III ar resident, and owner since 2005
NN = co orginal Pips Cable Property. wish to
inform you that donot understand the currently publsed plans forthe aforementioned property st
550 King Sireet West, and have several concems about the intended use ofthe severed property. After
seeing the Notices from the Chy Cer and the Planning Doprtmentinthe Recorder & Times on August
9, 201, subsequently received copes ofthese documents ent from the Cit by mal iret om
But these natien re unear and not consistent. a reeived atonal information ata meeting |
requested with Jonathan Faurschou ofthe Cys Planning Department, on August 25, 2018,

fascally the descriptions provided inthe Citys documentation are non-specific; the descriptions vary
from dacumentto document ard they are only stated in “assessment and zoning speak" —nothing 3
local resident can relate to or understand. On the proposed severance document our smal enclave of
‘townhouses a the comer of King and Centre Street sna represented accuratay onthe included map,
and the roadways adjacent tothe Cable Property, with the exception of King Street, do not seem to
ppear at ll (they would be useful to dary the boundaries ofthe property and the severance under
Aiscusson), There alzo zero info concersing the location ofthe propased structures (elementary
schoo, double oe pad, parking, et) on the property in question, nor about the proposed easements
‘or se-yard requlremants, particularly onthe westside wl be staring Int classrooms, with bells
Fingng all day every day, and students before and afterschool and during thelr recesses screaming in
imy backyard!?112 Whats happening tothe “qulet enjoyment” that | anticipated when purchased my
Broce home in 2006, for my retirement? Where, EXACTLY, wl the school and other facities be
located? And what “buffer is proposed between the school, the playards parking etc, atthe rear of
iy property? feel, bacause ofthe location of my property, wil be directly impacted bythe curently
planned development ofthe Cable Property lands,

Both the proposed elementary schoo! (on the wert ke) and the twin lee pads (onthe eastside) will
‘generate a significant incresce in traffic on King Stree, with much turning of school buses, cars, ms,
te, King Street already heavy travelled, being a main east-west artery into and out ofthe Cty asthe
‘municipal portion of Highway 2 along the St. Lawrence River. Last year the Cty recognized the traffic
problems on King Street by reconfiguring the taficlanes from four lanes to two, providing a centre left-
‘turing ane currently uted by many drivers asa passing lane, and not currently policed adequately),
‘nd including bioye lanes on both sides going east and west. The current configuration I defitely an
improvement, in many but nt al case; the trafic on King Street has slowed, with the exception of
motorcyces, school buses and semi-trucktrallers who continue to consider the stretch across the Cable
Property (and beside St awrance Pa) asa straightaway for acceleration!

Drainage ofthe Cable Property ha always been a problem since the housing construction on the west
‘side began in 2006, An open ich stretches the fullength behind the houses built on the eastside of
‘Susanna Lane and all along the eat side of Centre Street. A huge surface drain is located behind
Susann Lane which, lunderstand, the City takes responsblity for cleaning and clearing debris
(atthough am not sure ofthe frequency ofthat effort ~ every two years?) The Cty I defintely
‘aware ofthe resulting problems, including the flood ofthe Centre treat houses (twice) when they
‘were frst built. The builder was permitted by the ity andthe owner ofthe Cable Property to dg the
Urainage itch deeper from 4 feet to feet), and to augment the huge drain at the south end ofthe
itch by dling large hole in the drains concrete base, below the drains original ste surface rid,
‘The length of the ditch now Includes bul rushes, poison parsnip and ducks, aswell as lunch bag, candy

wrappers, coffee cups and water bottles! While the ditch sloped 60 degraes on the eas side (athe
Cy Engineer inacated as a roqulrement at the time ofthe digging) the ctch wal is vertical (90
gress) on the Westside III tere was nt sufficient space to slope the ditch

rng wall onthe westside ofthe dltch
absolutely requlred, ora more complex burled drainage system must be built, expecially when the Cable

Property lands are being developed!

QUESTIONS:

4. Mow can consent to sever and re-zone the Cable Property be granted on August 24%, when the public
meeting Is not scheduled until September 4? (Am Ito presume thet the decison to sever the
property in question and change the zoning to “instutional Area snot subject to public
‘Bscussion?)

2. How does the City propose to reduce the expected noise (school bal, large numbers of eildren
regularly paying outdoors local traffic resulting from the elamentar school andthe Ice pad
‘Configuration, to minimize the Impact on adjacent residents? Significant property easements? Buffer
tone? Trees and shrubbery plantings? Fencing?

3. How can the City minimize the impact of increased trafic onthe already-busy King Street? Restrictive
‘access roads? Turing zones? No left urns? Traffic lights? Speed bumps an King Street and/or on the
‘czess roads) to the new faces and parking areas?

4, Wilt all the trees on the aflacted aroas be cut down: both the hug, old cedars currently along King
Street (that at asa traffic noise buffer for local residents 25 well as homes fr thousands of birds,
squirrels, et.) and the old maples and other deciduous trees further in on the Cable Property? Wil
ail or some of, the besutul wilows st the north end ofthe property also be affected?

5 What wil be done to facilitate bettor drainage ofthe severed property (550 King Street West) that
wilalleviate the risk of lading andthe continuing erosion of our properties on the west ide ofthe
Cable Property?
