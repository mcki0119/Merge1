Brockville ON KBV 7AS

Dear Ms. Seale,

During 2007, we made a presentation to Brockville City Council seeking its
‘support for our project to designate the St. Lawrence River, between Kingston and the
‘Quebec border, a Canadian Heritage River. We are re pleased to report that ater
‘much work over several years, the process is nearing completion. TIARA (The
‘Thousand Islands Area Residents’ Association) undertook the project feeling strongly
that the St. Lawrence, bound up closely with so much of Canada’s proud history, and
With its ouistanding natural and cultural values, richly daserves such a nomination,
‘There are currently 37 designated "Heritage Rivers” in Canada and it was
inconceivable to us that the Upper St. Lawrence should not be among them.

Following our presentation in 2007, we were encouraged and gratetul to receive a
letter of support from your municipality for our intiatve. Since then, after several years of
research, dur nomination document was prepared and formally presented to the
Canadian Heritage Rivers Board of Directors in May 2011. (This document is attached if
you wish toreviow it) The Board’s final requirement is that TIARA ask each
‘municipality along the river to confirm its endorsement of our nomination by a
Motion of Couneil. (We have attached a draft motion which Counell may wish to
consider

(Our volunteers would be very glad to answer any further questions you may have
about the designation or the process. We can perhaps accomplish this by
correspondence, or we would be happy to attend one of your Council meetings for this
purpose, if you wish

‘As alast step, the Canadian Heritage Rivers Board will present our nomination
to the Minister of Environment Canada for final approval. We are looking forward to the
day when the St. Lawrence can offically join this “hall of fame" of Canadian rivers, a
designation of which we will ll be proud.

Yours sincerely,
Bla Mackirtook

Subject: ‘TIARA nomination of St Lawrence as 2 Canadian Heritage River

‘Attachments: SLHR Letter to Brockvledocs St Lawrence Project Final to CHRS 5 May, 2011 pdf

Dear Ms. Pascoe Merkley,

To introduce myself, 1am a volunteer member of TIARA, the Thousand Islands Area Residents’ Association. |
‘am writing to you as a member of the committee seeking nomination of the St. Lawrence River as a Canadian
Heritage River. We are following up on the support that the City of Brockville gave our project in 2007. The
attached letter will give you the background. The Nomination document has now been prepared (also
attached), and part ofthe process requires reaffirmation from each ofthe riverside municipalities that they
Continue to support the nomination.

| understand that you are away for a few weeks, but | thought | would send you some information now about
this initiative (which | have already sent to Sandra Seale) , and when you return, I'd be very happy to discuss it
with you, and answer any questions you may have prior to the March 4 2014 meeting of the Economic
Development and Planning Committee meeting.

We understand that at its February 4 2014 meeting, the Economic Development and Planning Committee
asked fora litle more information about TIARA’s nomination of the St. Lawrence as a Canadian Heritage
River, and that one concern was whether it would impact the Town's Official Plan,

The short answer is that, no, there willbe no conflict with the Offical Plan, nor with any other by-laws the City
might have. | quote from the Canadian Heritage River's own website:

Legislation: No new legislation is created when a river is designated to the CHRS. All protective actions on
Canadian Heritage Rivers depend on existing laws and regulations, and respect the rights of Aboriginal
peoples, communities, private landowners, and other stakeholders. Governments retain thelr jurisdictional
powers and management responsibilities throughout the nomination and designation process.

‘Mandate: The Canadian Heritage Rivers System (CHRS) was established in 1984 by federal, provincial and
territorial governments to conserve rivers with outstanding natural, cultural and recreational heritage, to
give them national recognition, and to encourage the public to enjoy and appreciate them.

Just to clarify bit further, here is what our committee put together to describe the aim ofthis designation:

‘The aim of achieving Heritage River designation is to increase public and private awareness of
the current status and great history of the St Lawrence River. This title will help the river,
acquire its rightful place among the most important and celebrated natural resources that
defines eastern North America. Through the title of Heritage River status, the identity of the St
Lawrence River will be enhanced, raising its historic, social and environmental profile. The
purpose of this designation is primarily symbolic and will support a sense of social responsibility


Page 11 of 84

and collective goodwill towards the river itself. A secondary purpose of this designation is to
announce globally that the St Lawrence is amongst the major rivers in the world, allowing all
‘Canadians to reflect on this environmental treasure.

‘We do not foresee any required further actions, beyond that of building solidarity amongst the
various municipalities. Our goal is to collectively recognize and celebrate all the ways that the St
Lawrence River sustains diverse communities, both natural and man-made.

So, as you can see, its primarily a ceremonial ttle, and itis up to the communities along the shores ofthe St.
Lawrence how they wish to use the designation. Each may wish to highlight it in their community events, or
celebrate it on their websites or other promotional places, or in more tangible ways.

| would be happy to answer any further questions thatthe EDP Committee or Council may have, ether by
correspondence or in person. Tam looking forward to hearing from you,

RECOMMENDATION

THAT Zoning By-law 194-94 be amended to rezone lands with municipal address 72,
74, 76 and 78 Murray Street from R2 — General Residential Zone to R3 - General
Residential Special Exception Zone which would permit the semi-detached dwellings
located on the property and would establish site-specific provisions In accordance with
existing conditions, to facilitate severance into four (4) separate lots each containing
‘one (1) semi-detached dwelling unit.

PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations on an application for
‘amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 respecting the property at 72,
74, 76 and 78 Murray Street.

BACKGROUND

Mr. Bob Jordan, Jordan — Bennett Geomatics Inc., acting on behalf of William and Lesia
Maxwell, owners of lands described as Lots 7, 8 and 9, Partof Lots 5 and 8, Block 3,
Pian 67, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, municipal address 72, 74, 76 and 78
Murray Street (as shown on Schedule ““A”), has submitted an application for an
amendment to Zoning By-law 194-04 which would, if approved, rezone the subject
lands to establish a zone which permits the existing semi-detached dwellings located on
the property and establishes appropriate zone provisions (lot areas, lot frontages, and
building setbacks) based on existing conditions.

Over multiple years 1982, 1986, 1989 & 1990, the properties were purchased
separately by the Maxwells. Due to the properties being purchased under the same
‘ownership, they have merged and are now considered one parcel of land. The owners
Intend to sever the property to provide for freehold ownership of each of the four (4)
semi-detached dwelling units, however, this is presently precluded because of the
‘current zoning on the subject property.

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

Provincial Policy Considerations:

72, 74,76 and 78 Murray Street, City Of Brockville

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2005 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
consistent with” the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of potential
Provincial interest.

Section 1.1.3.1 states that “Settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and their
vitality and regeneration shall be promoted’.

Section 1.1.3.2 states that “Land use pattems within settlement areas shall be based
on:
a. densities and a mix of land uses which:
a. efficiently use land and resources;
b. are appropriate for, and efficiently use, the infrastructure and public
service facilities which are planned or available, and avoid the need
{or their unjustified andlor uneconomical expansion; and
c. minimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, and
promote energy efficiency in accordance with policy 1.8; and
b. a range of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
accordance with the criteria in policy 1.1.3.3."

Section 1.1.3.3 states that “Planning Authorties shall identify and promote opportunities
{or intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated taking into
account existing building stock or areas, including Brownfield sites, and the availabilty
of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilties required to
accommodate projected needs.”

Section 1.4.3 states, among others, that “Planning authories shall provide for an
appropriate range of housing types and densities to meet projected requirements of
current and future residents of the regional market area by:
b. Permiting and faciltating:
1,_ all forms of housing required to meet social, health and well-being
requirements of current and future residents; and,
2. all forms of residential intensification and redevelopment in
accordance with policy 1.1.3.3

‘The overall proposal does not change the existing land use, rather, will facilitate the
severance of the lands for freehold ownership of each unit. No change to existing
‘municipal infrastructure will be needed. The proposal will add to the mix of housing
types available for home ownership within the area.

The proposed zoning amendment, while minor in nature, is consistent with the P.P.S.

Official Plan Considerations

The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
growth, development, and change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Plan designates the subject property as “Neighbourhood Area’

‘The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned.

Section 2.3 outlines strategic planning themes which includes “A Sustainable, Healthy,
and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, “A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities", and “A Well-Pianned Responsive City’

‘The proposed intensification achieves the above objectives. The proposal legally
intensifies existing serviced lots within the urban area; and, is located within walking
distance of a number of amenities, services, and recreational faciities that meet
residents’ dally needs.

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. More specifically,
Sections 3.2.4.1 and 3.2.4.3 outline policies for the scope of development within
"Neighbourhood Areas” as focusing on low to medium density housing, infiling on
‘existing lots of record and the rounding-out of existing development patterns while
ensuring that the character of the neighbourhoods is preserved. More specifically
various forms of residential intensification such as infling and the creation of accessory
‘dwelling units are to be encouraged, where appropriate. These general Neighbourhood
‘Area policies are further refined under Section 3.2.4.3 wherein small scale residential
intensification is permitted in all Neighborhood Areas where infrastructure is adequate
and where there are no significant physical constraints.

‘The proposal satisfies all the criteria required within the Official Plan. As the buildings
have already been In place for some time and no change to the building footprints has
been proposed, it can be concluded that there will be little to no impact on adjacent
property owners.

Zoning By-law Considerations:

‘The current zoning on the property with municipal addresses 72, 74, 78 and 78 Murray
Street is R2 ~ Single Unit Residential Zone under City of Brockvile Zoning By-law 194-

94, as amended. The requested Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94
would, if approved, rezone the subject lands from the current R2 — Single Unit
Residential Zone to an R4 - General Residential Zone to permit the semi-detached
‘dwellings currently located on the property to be severed into four (4) separate lots with
‘one residential unit on each. In considering the proposed zoning change, the following
items were considered:

1. Lot Area and Frontage:

Zoning by-law 194-94 requires a minimum lot area of 270.0 m* (2,906.3 ft?) for a
‘semi-detached dwelling and a minimum lot frontage of 9.0 metres (29.5 feet) for
each unitot. The proposed amendment is requesting reductions to these
‘minimums. The lot frontage for Retained Lands "A" is proposed to be reduced by
5.34% (14.44 square metres (155.0 square feet) and the lot frontage by 2.4%
(0.29 metres (0.95 feet).

‘The requests proposed are minimal decreases, and the proposal is consistent
with the Official Pian, and to the Provincial Policy Statement relating to mixed
densities.

2. Lot Setbacks:

Zoning by-law 194-94 requires that a minimum interior side yard setback of 1.5
metres (5.0 feet) be followed with the exception of existing structures where legal
non-complying status exists.

‘The inital buildings (garage included) were constructed on or around 1945. Due
to the proposed lot line between the two (2) separate dwellings (Proposed
‘Severance “A” and Proposed Severance 'B") bisecting the existing driveway and.
‘existing garage in the rear of the property, two (2) minor side yard setbacks are
needed to be established.

‘The proposed side yard reductions to an accessory structure (garage) is from the
required 1.0 metre (3.3 feet) to 0.0 metres (0.0 feet) as the garage Is proposed to
be separated by an interior wall and shared by Severed Lot “A” and Severed Lot
>

3. Requested Zoning:

Staff have reviewed the requested zoning of R4 — General Residential and have

‘amined the uses permitted within the R4 - General Residential Zone and
believe that an increase in zoning density and uses from the current R2 ~ Single
Unit Residential to an R3 ~ General Residential Special Exception Zone is more

File: 014471

appropriate for the proposed lots. The R4 ~ General Residential permits more
‘compact form that the R3 ~ General Residential Zone does (Townhouse
Dwellings, Maisonette Dwellings, Boarding/Rooming/Lodging, etc.). Due to the
surrounding R2 — Single Unit Residential Zones, staff believe that an R3 ~
General Residential Zoning will satisfy the requirements for the semi-detached
dwellings to be severed. This was communicated to the applicant and the
applicant is in agreement with an R3 - General Residential Special Exception
Zone,

Reductions of various zone provisions are one of the effects of residential intensification
in an older area. Accordingly, itis reasonable to recognize the existing conditions in a
new site specific zone.

‘Should the recommendations above be accepted by Council, the zone would read
similar to the following:

"RI-XI-1

The uses permitted in the R3-X3-1 Zone shall be those permitted in the R3-
General Residential Zone.

The zone provisions for the R3-X3-1 Zone shall be the same as for the R3-
General Residential Zone, save and except forthe following:

72Murray | 74 Murray | 76Murray | 78 Murray

Minimum Lot Frontage | 11.71 m NA NA NA
Minimum Interior Side
Yard to an accessory NA | 0.0m/(North) | 0.0m(South) | N/A
structure

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.
‘As noted in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed amendment to Zoning By-
law 194-94 for 72, 74, 76 and 78 Murray Street is consistent with the PPS and with the
relevant policies of the City’s Official Plan.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with the requested rezoning of the subject properly are the
responsiblity of the Owner,

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for zoning amendment for 72, 74, 76 and 78 Murray Street, itis
reasonable to amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to permit the semb
detached dwellings located on the property with site-specific provisions which recognize
‘existing conditions, and would facilitate severance into four (4) separate lots. This is
reflected in the recommendation at the beginning of this report

Meeting was held by the Economic Development and Planning Committee. Notice of
the Public Meeting was advertised in the Brockville Recorder and Times Newspaper on
9 January 2014 and was citculated to property owners within 120.0 metros (400.0 feet)
of the subject property. In addition, two (2) signs were posted on the subject property
advising that the lands are the subject of Applications for Amendment to the City of
Brockville Official Plan and City of Brockville Zoning by-law 194-94. Comments from
City Departments and affected agencies wore also solicited. An excerpt from the
minutes of the Public Meeting is attached as Schedule “C”.

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

Provincial Policy Statement Considerations:

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2006 has boon issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
Consistent with" the Provincial Policy Statement.

‘The applications propose to amend the City of Brockville Official Plan and Zoning By-
law 194-94 to permit a health club in addition to the permitted uses at 1965 California
Avenue.

From a review of the PPS, there are some relevant staterents/policies under Part V,
Section 1 "Building Strong Communities". The preamble in this section is a general
statement which reads as follows:

“Ontario's long-term prosperity, environmental health and social well-being depend on
wisely managing change and promoting efficient land use and development pattems.
Efficient land use and development pattems support strong, livable and healthy
‘communities, protect the environment and public health and safety, and facilitate
‘economic growth.”

‘This general statement is followed by more specific policies, including the following
references which are of relevance to this application for zoning by-law amendment:

"1.1.1 Healthy, livable and safe communities are sustained by:

) accommodating an appropriate range and mix of residential, employment
(including industrial, commercial and institutional uses), recreational and open
‘space uses to meet long-term needs;

@) avoiding development and land use patterns which may cause environmental
(or public health and safety concems:

‘Agents: 2341246 Ontario Inc.

Files: 009-03 & D14-172

Section 1.3.1, states that Planning Authorities shall promote economic development
and competitiveness by:

1. providing for an appropriate mix and range of employment (including industrial,
‘commercial and institutional uses) to meet long-term needs;

2. providing opportunites for a diversified economic base, including maintaining a
ange and choice of suitable sites for employment uses which support a wide
range of economic activities and ancilary uses, and take into account the needs
‘of existing and future businesses;

{3 planning for, protecting and preserving employment areas for current and future
uses; and

4, ensuring the necessary infrastructure is provided to support current and
projected needs.

‘Section 6.0, defines Employment Areas as those areas designated in an official plan for
Clusters of business and economic activities including, but not limited to, manufacturing
warehousing, offices, and associated retail and ancillary facilities.

The Provincial Policy Statement encourages municipalities to be concemed about the
needs of existing and future businesses that would establish in our business parks. The
availabilty of vacant space in a fully serviced bullding may be suitable from the health
club operator's perspective. However, when examining Policy 1.3.1, subsections 2 and
3 above, consideration should be given to protecting and preserving employment areas
by providing for the establishment of appropriate land uses. As stated by the Director of
Economic Development, the proposed commercial use is not compatible with
production processing and warehousing and that the presence of such uses, at least in
‘some cases, will deter investment attraction of potential industrial tenants within the
subject plant site and area.

Being Brockville’s primary Business Park, many commercial vehicles and transports
make their way through this area on a daily basis. However, due to other uses within
the close proximity, passenger vehicle traffic has become more significant as people
are using Califomia Avenue and Laurier Boulevard as bypass routes. The proposal may
‘cause even more of an increase in relation to traffic and congestion, Traffic counts
‘supplied by the City of Brockville Operation Department revealed an average of 26,143
vehicles per day (2010 data) at this intersection.

Official Pi

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
‘growth, development, and change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Plan designates the subject property as “Employment Area’.

“The Official Plan’s goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
‘amenities, and is well planned.

Section 2.3 oustines strategic planning themes which includes “A Sustainable, Healthy,
and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, “A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities’, and "A WellPlanned Responsive City". Specifically, “A High
Quality of City Services and Amenities" outlines among others, that the City is to
“provide employment lands with access to strategic transportation corridors and other
transportation facilities" and “consider the impact of decision making with respect to land
Use and infrastructure on transportation networks and options”.

Section 3.2.5, states that, “the Employment Areas are to promote a diverse economic
base by maintaining a range and choice of suitable employment sites that support a
range of employment and ancilary uses. The Employment Areas are the focus of major
concentrations of industial-related employment growth and development in the City,
which may include manufacturing, logistics operations, warehousing, distribution, offices
and related industrial and business park uses, in addition to ancilary commercial uses
serving the Employment Area. Employment Areas do not support institutional uses or
estination-oriented commercial and shopping uses, such as Large Format Retail uses.”

Section 3.2.5 also states among others, that It shall be the policy ofthe City that:
1. The location of Employment Areas is designated on Schedule 1. In
accordance with the policies of Section 4.7, Employment Areas shall bo the
focus of employment growth and shall accommodate a range of uses
including manufacturing, logistics operations, warehousing, distribution,
offices and related industrial and business park uses, in addition to ancillary
commercial uses serving the Employment Area. Employment Areas shall not
support institutional uses or destination-oriented commercial and. shopping
uses, such as Large Format Retail uses.
2, Empioyment Areas shall promote economic development and
competitiveness by:

LL providing a range and mix of employment uses to provide for a diversified
‘economic base;

ii. maintaining a range and choice of suitable sites for employment uses to
support a wide range of employment activities and related uses to
accommodate both local and regional markets;

li, accommodating employment uses on full municipal water, wastewater and
stormwater management systems, to the satisfaction of the City;

lv, ensuring that certain employment uses are protected from intrusion by
incompatible sensitive land uses;

providing an appropriate level of transportation infrastructure;

|. directing employment related traffic to arterial roads, and away from local
residential streets to the extent possible; and

vil, protecting significant Natural Heritage Features, areas and their functions.

7. Employment Areas shall be protected and preserved for employment uses
and the City shall discourage the conversion of Employment Areas for other
uses. The conversion of lands from Employment Areas to non-employment
uses shall only be considered through a comprehensive review of this Plan,
and only where it is demonstrated that the land is not required for
‘employment purposes over the long-term and that there is a demonstrated
‘need for the conversion. A comprehensive review is an Official Plan review
which may be initiated at any time by the City or an Official Plan Amendment
which is initiated or adopted by the City in accordance with the policies of

Based on policies above as well as comments received from Dave Paul, Director of
Economic Development, Planning staff are of the opinion that the proposed health club
is not in keeping with the general overall intont of the Official Plan. Mr. Paul states that
the use is based on the premise of retail/service, and that commercial uses are not
‘compatible with production processing and warehousing. This statement reiterates tho
policies in section 3.2.5 that directly states that "Employment Areas do not support
institutional uses or destination-oriented commercial and shopping uses, such as Large
Format Retail uses". Staffs opinion is that a “Health Club", open to the public, is a
<destination-oriented commercial use.

Section 4.7.1 deals directly with Employment Areas and states, “Employment Areas are
intended to accommodate industrial, manufacturing, logistics and related uses that
require separation from sensitive land uses. Existing employment areas include the
Broome Business Park, and the Western Industrial Park, which have excellent access
to Highway 401, as well as lands along the CN and CP rail lines. The intent of the
Employment Areas is to ensure that there are sufficient lands to accommodate a full
range of employment uses while ensuring land use conflicts are minimized and
‘separation distances are adhered to.

Section 4.7.2 further refines the general policy listed above and deals directly with
Permitted Uses within the Employment Areas. This section states, among others that:

1. The predominant use of land shall be a wide range of office and industrial

uses, and ancillary service commercial uses serving the Employment Area

‘employees, subject to the policies of this Section and locational criteria.

Heavy industrial uses include manufacturing facilites and uses for storage,

‘processing, refinement or production of hazardous or toxic substances. Light

industrial uses include small-scale facilities, warehouses, wholesale

establishments, and offices and business services. Prestige employment

‘uses include office employment uses and associated accessory uses such as
restaurants, parking facilities and business services.
2. Rotail and Commercial uses associated with and clearly ancilary to the main
‘employment use shall be permitted.
3. Uses accessory to any of the permitted uses in the Employment Area shall be
permitted.
Based on the above policies and the request to amend Section 4.7.2 to add a site
specific policy to allow a Health Club as a permitted use in addition to other permitted
uses within the Employment Area designation, staff are of the opinion that there are
‘other more suitable locations for this type of commercial use within the City. Using a
location within our Business Park for a commercial use of this nature and encouraging
members of the general public into the area may increase the potential for land use
conflict and does not warrant a decision in favour of the proposed amendment.

During the Public Meeting of 4 February 2014, the applicants made a presentation
{attached as Schedule “E” to this report) stating that they had multiple companies
within the area interested in the concept of a 24-hour gym and were looking forward to
this type of business being available within close proximity. However, these businesses
should they be interested, are permitted to have a gym for their employees, accessory
to their current use, which in turn is not drawing the public in from other areas within the
City.

Staff are of the opinion that this type of use should remain accessory within our
industrial park, as increased traffic and non-compatible uses may deter investment and
cause future problems with trafic and land use compatibility.

Zoning B ati

The current zoning on the property with municipal addresses 1965 California Avenue is
M1 = Industrial Park Zone under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94, as amonded.
‘The requested Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 would, if
approved, rezone the subject lands from the current M1 — Industrial Park Zono to Mt ~
Industrial ‘Park Zone Special Exception Zone to permit a ‘Health Club" as a permitted
Use in addition to all other uses permitted within the M1 — Industrial Park Zone.

Based on review of Zoning By-law 194-94 and the request above to permit a health club
within the M1 — Industrial Park, it should be noted that a “Health Club” is permitted
within most commercial zones with the exception of C1 — Local Commercial Zones and
C5 ~ Office Retail Commercial Zones. The availability of zones that permit a “Health
Ciub’ provides ample opportunities for the applicants to establish in other locations that
‘are more suitable for this type of commercial use. Based on 2012 vacancy rates
supplied by the City of Brockville Economic Development Office, there is 7.2% of
‘commercial space avallable for this use. However, a full review of location criteria
would need to be conducted prior to establishing in these areas to determine the current
zone.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

‘A review of the Provincial Policy Statement and relevant policies within the Official Plan
thas been conducted and is provided within the Analysis Section of this report.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with the requested Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-Law
‘Amendment for the subject property are the responsibilty of the Owner and/or
Applicant.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
Tespecting the request for zoning amendment for 1365 California Avenue, it is
Concluded the proposal does not follow the general intent of the PPS and Official Pian
a they pertain to permitted uses within the employment area. This use has potential to
be incompatible with surrounding current and future uses, and is more aligned to a
resident market and may cause issues with increased trafic. The recommendations
refined at the beginning of this report are to deny the requested amendments to the
Offical Plan and Zoning By-law 194-94

date: January 14, 2014

We are unable to support the subject zoning application enabling the inclusion of a health

Use is aligned to a resident market versus patrons of an existing industrial use within the

property.

‘The rationale for this position is based on the premise that retail/service and commercial
Uses are not compatible with production processing and warehousing applications,
particularly within the same facility. Further, the presence of such uses, at least in some
‘cases, will deter investment attraction of potential industrial tenants within the subject
plant site. We have accounts on record to validate this viewpoint.

One final consideration is the precedent that would be establish in providing further
concessions for additional retail/service businesses within the John G. Broome Park that
‘could erode the integrity of the park's primary use. Industrial clients tend to profer uses
‘common to their own operation with the offering of value chain businesses that can

Proposed Amendment to Sign By-law 84-88

‘Applicant: Eastern Engineering Group Inc.

Owner: 2343674 Ontario Ine

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS:

‘Various sections of the Municipal Act provide municipalities with the authority to pass by-
laws to control signage and other advertising devices. Signs within the Corporation of the
City of Brockville are regulated under City of Brockville By-law 84-89, known as the Sign
By-law.

‘The application requests that City of Brockville Sign By-law 84-89 be amended to grant
approval for the existing ground sign at 2438 Parkedale Avenue to be altered and allow an
‘electronic message board (sign) to replace the current letter board signage area as shown
‘on Schedule “A” to this report. The electronic message board (sign) is proposed to be
1.91 metres (6.26 feet) by 1.22 metres (4.0 feet) per side for a total area of 4.6 square
metres (50.0 square feet). The total area ofthe entire ground sign is proposed to be 15.8
‘square metres (170.0 square fee!)

The property is zoned C2 — General Commercial Zone and designated as Mixed Use and
‘Commercial Area within the Mixed Use Node under the City of Brockvile Official Plan. The
‘ground sign was installed in 1987 and met all by-law regulations relating to location and
size at the time. Photos ofthe site are attached as Schedule “B” to this report.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

2438 Parkedale Avenue is located along one of Brockville main roadways andi zoned C2
= General Commercial Zone. The proposed sign meets all by-law regulations, however, it
is tobe of aniluminated and lashing display nature and therefore requires amendment to
be permitted.

By-law 84-89, as amended, Part 5, Section 5.10 states that “Mluminated or luminous signs
‘of an animated and/or flashing nature shall not be permitted.

To-date, there have been nine (9) electronic message signs authorized within the City:

125 Stewart Boulevard, Brockville Shopping Centre (1999)

555 Stowart Boulevard, 1000 Islands Toyota (2001)

2510 Parkedale Avenue — Thousand Island Secondary School (2004)
2288 Parkedale Avenue, St. Lawrence College (2006)

403 Broome Road (2012)

1815 Kensington Boulevard, Ange-Gabriel (2012)

1000 Islands Mall (2012)

St Mary's Catholic School (2013)

Millwood @ Parkedale Avenue forthe Memorial Centre (2013)

‘The above-noted signs were evaluated from safety, traffic, visibility, driver distraction and

‘overhead clearance concems and the final locations were tailored to resolve the concerns
brought forward.

‘The proposed sign design and location has been circulated to the Operations Department,
Environmental Service Department, Building Department and the Brockville Police, No
‘objections were received.

Staff would also lke to inform Council that no off-site advertising is permitted within the
‘Sign By-law. Therefore, should Council approve the proposed amendment, advertising
Pertaining to The Barley Mow is the only advertising permitted.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Allcosts associated with this application and any further requirements are the responsibilty
of the Applicant.

CONCLUSION:

‘The Planning Department has no objections to the proposed amendment to City of
Brockville Sign By-law 84-89. The proposed amendment to allow for the existing ground
sign to be altered to add an electronic message board (sign) is similar to other approved
signage on lands within the City (1000 Islands Mall, Pro Oil Changers, TISS, Memorial
Centre). This conclusion is provided in the recommendations section of his report.

ORIGIN:

Wisor/Evely, acting on behaif of 653973 Ontario Ltd. (Mr. Joe Malovic), has requested
that various lots within Registered Plan 375, known as "Bridlewood Subdivision” be

follows:

"60 (4) The council of a focal municipality may by by-law designate any
plan of subdivision, or part thereof, that has been registered for eight years
‘or more, which shall be deemed not to be a registered plan of subdivision
for the purposes of subsection (3). R.S.0. 1990, c, P.13, s. 50 (4).”

‘The underiying registered plan of subdivision forthe lands subject to this application was
created in 1981, and is subject to a Subdivision Agreement between Dodge and Dodge
Corporation Limited and the Corporation of the City of Brockvile authorized by By-law
234-81. This Agreement has been the subject of various amendments through the years
Which have addressed the on-going development of various phases of the subdivision
and change of ownership from Dodge and Dodge Corporation Limited to 653973 Ontario
Ut,

‘Accordingly, the plan of subdivision exceeds the required minimum of eight (8) years to
permit a portion of the subdivision to be considered as not being registered,

‘Since 1981, the subdivision has been under development in various phases. Schedule
“G" to this report illustrates development to-date within the subdivision.

‘On 30 January 2014, the Planning Department received a request for various lots to be
deemed not to be registered. These lots have been determined by the developer to be
beyond the scope of his planned development at this time. In discussions with Planning
Department staff, Mr. Malovic has expressed his concem with the ongoing property tax
burden from carrying certain lots in Bridlewood Subdivision which have no foreseeable
development potential

FILE: 267-10

Lots 149 and 150, located on the east side of Dobbie Street, Lots 155 to 174, inclusive,
located on the future Ascot Street and Lots 181 to 185, inclusive, located on the west side
of the northerly extension of Bridlewood Drive all lie within an area subject to redesign of
the subdivision wherein the lots and street patterns have been amended by By-law
20-2000 such that the existing lots are no longer viable for development. Accordingly,
these lots should be deemed not to be registered.

Lots 245 to 249, inclusive, located on the south side of Crestwood Drive, east of
Bridlewood Drive, are somewhat isolated in an area initially proposed for development of
‘multiple residential development on the north side of Crestwood Drive with the remaining
Portion of the south side of Crestwood Drive east of Bridlewood Drive, being parkland, AS
‘no easterly extension of Crestwood Drive is anticipated by the developer at this time,
these lots could be deemed to not be registered.

Lots 4, 2, 9, 192, 139 and 194 are located at the west ond of Fitzsimmons Drive. These
lots and the associated extension of Fitzsimmons Drive represent the southern link to the
former Registered Plan 271 (Darling Eastem Resources Ltd. lands). Given that
evelopment ofthe adjacent lands is not anticipated in the foreseeable future and that a
pumping station is required to service the six (6) lots, it is not feasible to develop these
lots. The Operations Department and Environmental Services. Department have
submitted comments, requiring thatthe street be concluded with a turnaround bull to the
City’s satisfaction prior to deeming Lots 1, 2, 3, 132, 133 and 134 not to be registered.
Accordingly, itis recommended that these lots be deemed to not be registered only
‘upon completion ofthe required cu-de-sac.

vious Rel 1umn of Street Right-of Way oper:

With the original registration of the Registered Plan 375, the right-of-way for all future
streets within the subdivision were conveyed to the City of Brockville as well as various
required easements and reserves to facilitate the subdivision of land for residential
development.

By By-law 20-2000, all of Ascot Street and parts of Bridlewood Drive were authorized to
be conveyed to 653973 Ontario Lid. as part of a process which resulted in various
changes to the north end of Bridlewood Subdivision. Accordingly no additional lands
need be conveyed back to the developer as a result of the request for deeming various
lots in this vicinity not to be registered.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville Policy 6.4.5.1.14. addresses the matter of
deeming lots not to be registered as follows:

“14. The City may consider passing a By-law under the provisions of the Planning

REGISTERED PLAN 375

FILE: 267-10

‘Act dooming old registered, undeveloped plans which are inadequate due to
‘matters such as lot size, unsuitable access or undesirable location, not fo be
registered.”

Given that the lots in question consist of undeveloped lots which cannot or will not be
developed in the foreseeable future based on unsuitable access, undesirable location
and previous realignment of part of the subdivision which was undertaken in 2000
through By-law 20-2000, the request is considered by the Planning Department to be
reasonable.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Financial considerations to the City of Brockville would consist ofthe potential for reduced
taxation should reassessments by MPAC occur as expected upon completion of the
deeming process.

‘CONCLUSION:

It is appropriate for Council to support the following recommendations, and for the
necessary by-laws to be enacted:

1. Lots 149, 150, 185 to 174, inclusive, Lots 181 to 185, inclusive, and Lots 245 to 249,
inclusive, Registered Pian 375, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, be deemed not
registered; and

2. Lots 1, 2, 3, 192, 133, 134, inclusive, Registered Plan 375, City of Brockville, County
of Leeds, be deemed not registered upon completion of a turnaround at the west end
of Fitzsimmons Drive.

BRIDLEWOOD SUBDIVISION, PLAN 375 PLANNER |

‘OWNER: 653973 ONTARIO LTD.

RECOMMENDATION:

1. THAT the petition received from residents of Bridlewood Subdivision requesting
elimination of the required sidewalk on the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive west of
Montrose Street, be received, and

2. THAT, while the sidewalk is not warranted at this time, the request to eliminate the
sidewalk be denied.

ORIGIN:

Mr. J. Malovic, representing 653973 Ontario Ltd., the developer of Bridlewood
Subdivision, has submitted 2 petition from fifteen residents of lots located on or near
Fitzsimmons Drive requesting that the required sidewalk planned for the north side of
Fitzsimmons Drive west of Montrose Street be deleted. The petition reads as follows:

“We the undersigned property owners in Bridlewood Subdivision, north side
of Fitzsimmons Drive, in the City of Brockville, respectfully petition the
construction of a sidewalk on the north side of Fitzsimmons drive. We feel
thatthe existing sidewalk on the south side of Fitzsimmons Drive already
addresses the need for a safe and easily accessible walking route, and that
an additional sidewalk on the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive would
unnecessarly decrease driveway and front yard size.”

ANALYSISIOPTIONS:

Bridlewood Subdivision, Registered Plan 375, was created in 1981 with terms and
conditions for development specified in the Subdivision Agreement between Dodge and
Dodge Corporation Limited and the Corporation of the City of Brockville under By-law
234-81. This Plan of Subdivision and associated Subdivision Agreement has been the
Subject of various amendments throughout the years which have addressed the on-going
development of various phases of the subdivision and change of ownership from Dodge

‘and Dodge Corporation Limited to 653973 Ontario Ltd. Amongst many other
requirements, the developer's responsiblity to construct sidewalks in various locations
throughout Bridlewood Subdivision is specified.

‘Schedule “B", Clause 4 of the Subdivision Agreement addresses sidewalk requirements
within the subdivision. Specifically, it states that:

“Concrete sidewalks 1.5 metres in width shall be constructed on both sides of
Bridlewood Drive, Aspen Drive, Crestwood Drive, Fitzsimmons Drive, Shearer
Drive and Dobbie Street within the limits of the Plan.”

‘There are currently sidewalks on Fitzsimmons Drive as follows:

‘= the entire length of the south side of Fitzsimmons Drive from Bridlewood Drive to
the last house on the west end;

‘ the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive from Bridlewood Drive west to Montrose
Street; and

All existing sidewalks constructed within Bridlewood Subdivision are illustrated in
‘Schedule “A” to this report.

(On 11 February 2014, the Planning Department received a petition from fifteen residents
of the Fitzsimmons Drive area requesting that the required sidewalk planned for the north
side of Fitzsimmons Drive west of Montrose Street be deleted. The fifteen (15)
signatories to the petition represent owners/occupants of 12 dwelings on Fitzsimmons
Drive and one on Kingswood Street, and all but two (2) of the fifteen (15) would have the
yet-to-be built sidewalk located in front of their property.

‘The request has been circulated to various City Departments with the following results:

i. Police Department: "No issue’

li, Environmental Service's Department:

“Our experience has been that although there currently may not be any appetite for a
sidewalk on the north side, in the future when there has been a tum-over in ownership
that attitude may change. Secondly, the design of Bridlewood has always included
sidewalks on both sides of Fitzsimmons Drive, this in anticipation of it becoming more of
an arterial road than local once the property to the west is developed.”

‘Should the request be supported, the Subdivision Agreement, Scheduled °B”, Clause 4 a)
and b) must be amended to reflect the change to the sidewalk requirement,

‘CITY OF BROCKVILLE

OWNER: 653973 ONTARIOLTD.

FILE: 267-10

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville, Policy 5.2.2.4 subsection 3, addresses the
matter of sidewalks as follows:

"It shall be the policy of the City that:

3. Sidewalks shall generally be required on one side of Local Roads. In instances
where Local Roads lead directly to a school, park, community facility or other
facility which generates pedestrian traffic, or where the safety of pedestrians is of
‘particular concern, sidewalks shall be considered on both sides of the road.”

Fitzsimmons Drive is currently classified as a Local Road under the Official Plan, as itis
only serving lots with Bridlewood Subdivision. However, since the time of Subdivision
approval in 1981, the intention has been for Fitzsimmons Drive to connect through to a
future subdivision to be developed on the vacant lands abutting Bridlewood Subdivision
tothe west. When this land is developed, Fitzsimmons Drive wil ikely be upgraded to @
Collector Road. As such, Fitzsimmons Drive will be required to have sidewalks on both
sides as per the Official Plan for the City of Brockville Policy 5.2.2.3 subsection 4 which
addresses the matter of sidewalks as follows

"it shall be the policy of the City that:

4. Sidewalks shall generally be constructed on both sides of Collector Roads."

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.

‘There are no financial considerations to the City of Brockville with regard to construction
of sidewalks in developing areas, as the developer is held responsible for construction of
all new local infrastructure to meet City standards.

‘Although snow clearing is performed by the City upon completion of construction of
sidewalks, any further sidewalk maintenance only becomes the responsibilty of the City
‘once the subdivision or phases thereof are accepted by the City.

If sidewalks are not constructed on both sides of Fitzsimmons Drive at this time, and the
request to eliminate the requirement for the additional sidewalk is supported, it may fall
the City in the future to construct the length of sidewalk currently under consideration,

CONCLUSION:

ttis acknowledged that a second sidewalk is not warranted at this time on Fitzsimmons
Drive west of Montrose Street. However, with consideration to future needs, it is
recommended that no action be taken to eliminate the requirement for sidewalks on both
sides of Fitzsimmons Drive as specified in the Subdivision Agreement for Registered Plan
375 (Bridlewood Subdivision). This is consistent with the relevant polices contained in
