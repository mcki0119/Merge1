786 PEOPLE FED

We noticed a gap in low-
cost and free meals
provided to those
experiencing food
insecurity in our community
on Saturdays.

Since fall 2022, we've
hosted a free brunch every
weekend that has fed 786
kids and families.

NO MORE LATE FEES!

In 2022, the Library Board voted
to permanently eliminate late
fees, allowing our community
to more freely use our services
without worry, guilt or financial
penalty.

This move welcomed back
1,475 library cardholders, many
of them from households with
small children.

FUNDING CHALLENGES

The majority of our funding comes from the City
of Brockville, at $782,254 or 79% of our budget.
On average, Ontario's public libraries receive
96% of their budget from their municipalities.

79% 96%

This breaks down to just $36.06
per capita in taxpayer dollars.

LIBRARY IMPACT

Libraries are connected to the health, education,
prosperity and social cohesion of our community.

We are responding to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commitee’s calls to action by creating an Indigenous
Ways and Decolonisation position to reflect our
community and design a Library for everyone.

We are partnered with the Municipal Drug Strategy
Committee to address the root causes of individuals
struggling with substance use disorder in our
community.

Buying just two books costs more than the per capita
cost of the Library, but our impact goes beyond
books. The Library teaches early literacy skills to
children, bridges the digital divide, and provides a
warm gathering space for members of our community
in a political environment of increasing division and
social isolation.

WHAT OUR USERS HAVE TO SAY

"We haven't been able to experience
this sense of community since my
daughter was born."
"Warm, welcoming sense of
community, and lots of great
programs."
"When my mother was sick, the
library's endless supply of books
kept her going."
"My second home."
