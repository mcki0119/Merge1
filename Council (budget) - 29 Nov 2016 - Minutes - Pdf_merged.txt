Maximum 2% increase for Boards and Committees

Councillor Baker noted that direction was sent to City department, boards
and committees that the maximum 2017 budget increase was 2%. He
Indicated his understanding that there are from time to time special
circumstances that would cause a department's budget to be more than
2% but the Museum, Library and Cemetery boards should be able to
mitigate the increases for 2017 to reach a maximum of 2%. Council needs
to hold departments and boards to the guideline.
