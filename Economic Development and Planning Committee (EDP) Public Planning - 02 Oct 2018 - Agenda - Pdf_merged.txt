‘Attention: Andrew MeGinnis, MCIP, RPP, Dip MM.

Dear Sir: Re: Zoning Amendment Application
Planning Rationale
Pro Oil Change
103 Broome Road
Brockville, ON

‘Mr. Joe Norton, 2581027 Ontario Ine., owner of Pro Oil Change, Brockville, ON has submitted
‘an application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By Law 050-2014 to modify the use
of the business on the site, 103 Broome Road, Brockville, ON. The Zoning of the current site is
6-2

‘The proposed use ofthe site will be modified as follows:

1. Upgrading from oll changes and tres, to light mechanical work - alignments, front end
work, brakes, This isa complimentary business to what they currently offer, and
‘maintains a neat, clean organized appearance forthe facility. This will add employment
of skilled employment labour to the area through licensed technicians, and apprenticeship
courses to develop staff

Light mechanical work, specifically with regards to tires, alignments, front end work and
brakes are all work related tothe main use of the site curently. This would be under the
‘current C6-2 zoning for Automobile Service Staton as defined in 2.0 Definitions, A.22.
‘The Walmart also is in the C-6 zone and there is light mechanical work done inthis
property as well

2. Changing the zoning limitation from new car sales as per By Law C6 to inchude used car
sales, Prom a business operations perspective it does not make sense to allow new cat
sales, and not have used carsales due to trade in factors, and the ability to retail the

—_ |

page |

‘quality used vehicles that are 1-5 years old. The owner would lke the zoning revised to
allow sales of used cars

Permitting the sale of used cars is permitted cusrently in C6 zoning as an Automobile
Sales Establishment. The site would be used to display and sell newer used vehicles.
‘The site specific zoning for 103 Broome Road is permitted the uses in C6 Zone as per
section 6.3.9.2 of the Zoning By Law.

‘Throughout the City of Brockville, there are many multi use automobile shops waich
offer full service repairs, tire sales and automobile sales. Permitting the uses above
‘would allow the business to expand and provide employment in the City.

‘The site currently has 8 steel containers om ste, and would like to change the zoning to
allow up to 9. There were existing containers onthe site prior to zoning changes. They
tare an essential part of the business to provide our customers with tire storage onsite and
to store inventory forthe business. The containers are neatly organized, painted and
properly maintained. The owner wishes to modify the zoning to allow sea can storage
Containers for storage requirements in order to keep up with the increased demand due to
business expansion. Section 3.3 a i) 4 states that accessory uses for “sea ean” are not
permitted other than in an Employment Zone.

‘The surrounding properties to the south, east and north all fll into the
industria/eommercial zoning. ‘The property directly east is currently used as an outdoor
storage facility for lage vehicles and containers. The property tothe south on Parkedale
isa construction yard with storage of large vehicles, sea eans and multiple vehicles. The
property has also been « used car dealer. The uses of these lots are industrial in nature
and compared to the Pro Oil Change ste, which is kept neat and in good appearance, the !
neighbouring properties are less attractive. The proposed zoning change would allow Pro

il Change to keep the sea can containers neatly stored at the rear of their property,

adjacent tothe storage area to the east.

‘The sea cans in place prior to the zoning change are considered “legal non-complying”
‘The addition of further cans will not be visually distracting or unappealing considering
the surrounding properties. There are several instances in the City of businesses with sea
ccans being used for storage for automobile service centers and sales. ‘The zoning of C6
Power Centre Zone, in the ease ofthis property, is very closely located to the Business
ark zoning E and the uses are closely related. 1 permits the use of sea cans for
storage. Modification of the C6-2 to include the use of sea cans would allow the owner
to expand Pro Oil Change.

north east comer of the sit. It would act as temporary overflow parking during busy
seasonal time and also for the base below which the sea cans would be stored. The
‘granular pad would be graded and compacted and maintained. Granular parking storage
allows for water infiltration into the ground, lessening the need for stormwater
‘management requirements, This area is shown on the accompanying revised site plan by
owner.

“The gravel pad forthe sea cans and for temporary overflow parking would be consistent
with the neighbouring properties to the south and east, which both have gravel yards.
‘The gravel parking area in this ease would be smaller and used only during work days for
cars waiting in queue, and drop offs. The gravel would be compacted and maintained,
