‘August 22,2018

‘Summary of Propos:

The proposal involves the subdivision of the existing 1.97 ha property into 8 residential blocks
totaling up to 23 dwelling units. Proposed access would be provided via an extension of Flanders
Road with a connection to Laurier Boulevard to the south. Dwelling types proposed include mix
‘of single detached (4), semi-detached (8), and townhouse (11) units.

Discussion

The main interests of the CRCA in these applications are the provision of adequate stormwater
‘management und sediment and erosion controls and the preservation and protection of natural

heritage features,

‘The Stormwater Management and Site Servicing Report (SWM report) indicates that storm
‘sewers sized for the S-year storm event are proposed - under a proposed extension of Flanders
Road - connecting o the existing municipal storm sewer system on Laurier Blvd. discharging to

Buclls Creek

Quantity Controt
'No quantity control is proposed in the SWM report, As noted in the SWM report quantity control
will be provided by the existing Buells Creek Detention Basin, ‘The subject site falls within the
drainage area for which the DB (Detention Basin) was designed to attenuate lows,

Pease demonstrate that runoff yenerated trom the proposed Rockford Forest subdivision during
‘major sform events can be safely conveyed to Buells Creek via the Laurier Boulevard road-ditch

system.

Quality Controt
‘The SWM report indicates @ normal level (ie. 70% total suspended solids removal) quality
control requirement and proposed BMPs (Best Management Practices), including dizecting root
leaders to grassed areas, importation of pervious fill, reduced lot yrading, rear and side yard
swales, ete.

‘The Buells Creek Detention Basin was not designed to provide water quality control. Therefore
on-site sormal level water quality control must be provided, The proposed BMPs will be
beneficial to retain/promote infiltration, but not sufficient for the quality requirements of this
site. CRCA recommends additional on-site quality control measures to treat runoff from the

road surface.
{tis the opinion of CRCA staff that this site could benetit for the implementation of LID (Low

Impact Development) stormwater management. Features that may be considered include
infiltration trenches or bioretention cells along the proposed Flanders Road extension. Staff are


Page 12.0135,

Mr. Fauschow
‘August 2, 2014

also ofthe opinion thatthe proposed lots could be reconfigured to accommodate a facility at the
south end of the property. The proposed facility's) would need to meet the City of Brockville’s

‘maintenance schedule
Please include in the SWM report a section on maintenance for the proposed stormwater
management facilities (ez inspection/clean-out details, frequency/schedule, responsibilty).
‘Sediment and Erosion Conrrols

The sediment and erosion control measures described in the report are sufficient for Draft Plan
Approval

Auditional Comments

‘Since the recommendation for additional quality controls may potentially affect the size/layout of
‘the proposed lots, staff recommend that this item be addressed prior to draft plan approval.

{In subsequent submissions please include in the SWM report pre-levelopment and post-
development drainaye area maps (ie. with areas and eunof¥ coefficients) and caleulated pre and

post-development rainfall runoff rates forthe subject sit,

Recommendation

‘Staff recommend deferral of the application for Draft Plan of Subdivision Approval (OST-
14501) until such time that:

a) the issue of adequate quality contro is addressed to the satisfaction of the CRCA and

City of Brockville and;
+b) Anenvironmental impact statement (currently being prepared by Ecological Services) is

submitted and reviewed by CRCA staf,

(Once these items have been addressed to a level of satisfaction appropriate to allow for draft plan
approval, staff will provide alist of recommended conditions for approval

RE: EDP Report - Public Meeting - Stewart 8,

Good afternoon Maureen,

Regarding any proposed development along the Stewart Bld. corridor situated north ofthe Laurer Bhd intersection the
Fire Department would have concerns with water services for fire suppression purposes.

‘As this area is not presently serviced we would propose that any future development include the installation of fre
hydrants and water services capable of supporting building fie sprinkler systems.

Regards,

Subject: RE: CRCA Site Inspection

Me. Walker,

| was able to visit the site on Monday June 6, 2014) and completed a faily thorough site inspection to determine
Whether or not the wetland feature at the site would fall within the criteria for CRCA regulation under Ontario
Regulation 148/06. Based on my visit and review of aerialimagery and mapping, the wetland, at exists today, does not
‘meet the minimum size criteria (0.5 ha) nor ist hydrologically connected with a watercourse or other waterbody. AS
such, the wetland would not be subject to regulation by the CRCA,

The feature was likely quite larger in extent in the past. However, previous site alteration filing) has significantly
reduced the size ofthe wetland. Today, it exists asa small swamp with a central core of standing water and established
wetland vegetation with a number af "fingers" on the periphery of it, which are seasonally flooded. The feature does
provide a hydrologic function in that it acts as storage for local run-off from both the subject property and for run-off
from the adjacent Home Hardware development (584 Stewart Soulevard). Because ofthis, ts important that any
future ste alteration and development must be done in a way that continues to allows for run-off storage both from the
site and from adjacent properties. Specifically, adequate stormuater management must be provided in support of
future development

‘While the CRCA will not require permit approvals for development activity on the property, we will request to the City to
be involved inthe review of future development proposals in order to ensure the above is achieved. To ths point, we
strongly recommend consultation with tis office prior to undertaking site alteration activites.

Page 35 0135,
| trust this information i of assistance at this time. | have copied Ms. Pascoe Merkle from the Brockville Planning
Department on this emailso she is aware thatthe feature is not regulated but that CRCA staff should continue to be
circulated on any development applications on or near the site

Please contact me should you have any questions.

Best regards,
Mike
