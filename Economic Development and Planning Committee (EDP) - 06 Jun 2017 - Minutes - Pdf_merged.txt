Councillor Baker noted that he is unhappy with the number of like type gas
stations located in close proximity on Stewart Boulevard.

‘The Committee discussed options to limit uses for properties. J. Faurschou
stated that permitted uses for a zone are identified in the Zoning By-law.
Accordingly, Council has the ability to amend the By-law to prohibit gas
stations in particular zones. He added that in the case of a current
application for a new gas station, Council may deny the application but must
do so on a Planning basis. Denying an application may trigger an appeal by
the applicant to the OMB from the property owner.
