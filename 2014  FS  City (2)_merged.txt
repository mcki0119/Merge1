The St, Lawrence Lodge (the “Lodge") makes an annual assessment to the participating
‘muniipalites for operating expenditures and minor captal costs that are not funded by oer
‘sources of revenue (primarly resident fees and substiy from the Province of Ontario) The
Lodge tracks the resents Dased on the municipality that they Ived in prior to entering the

‘located 10 the municipalities based on a five-year rollng average of the percentage of
residents from ther jurisdiction, The Cys alocaion for 2014 was 65.5% (2018 - 56.5%)

Operating levies and any excess of operating revenue over expenditures (expenditures over
revenue) is allocate to the municipalities based on the percentage of assessments used for
that year

During the year, the Lodge allocated $3,070,204 from Surplus from Operations to a Capital
Reserve of which the Cl portion was $1,559,706.

nti the debentures are repaid in 2026. The munkialites have agreed to fund the balance of
