PURPOSE

BACKGROUND

‘Mr. Bob Jordan, Jordan ~ Bennett Geomatics inc., acting on behalf of William and Lesia
‘Maxwell, owners of lands described as Lots 7, 8 and 9, Part of Lots 5 and 8, Block 3,
Plan 67, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, municipal address 72, 74, 76 and 78
‘Murray Street (as shown on Schedule “A”), has submitted an application for an
amendment to Zoning By-law 194-94 which would, if approved, rezone the subject
lands to establish a zone which permits the existing semi-detached dwellings located on
the property and establishes appropriate zone provisions (lot areas, lot frontages, and
building setbacks) based on existing conditions.

Over muttiple years 1982, 1986, 1989 & 1990, the properties were purchased
separately by the Maxwells. Due to the properties being purchased under the same
‘ownership, they have merged and are now considered one parcel of land. The owners
intend to sever the property to provide for freehold ownership of each of the four (4)
semi-detached dwelling units, however, this is presently precluded because of the
current zoning on the subject property.

to Zoning By-law 194-94 with respect to lands described as Part of Lot 9, Concession 2,

all other uses currently permitted within the Employment Area Designation under the

‘The subject lands are currently occupied by a large warehouse which currently contains
a Scholastic Book Distribution Centre and was the former location of Purolator and the
Connection Warehouse. The Owner of the property would like to further amend the
Uses permitted to include a “Health Club” as a standalone business. The current policy
in the Official Plan, and the current M1 ~ Industrial Park Zone, permits uses accessory
to any of the permitted uses in the Employment Area (example: 3M would be permitted
to have a health club or fitness facility as an accessory use for their employees).

to: Planning Department ~ Andrew McGinnis:

from: David Paul, Director of Economic Development

Note the Application for Zoning Attached
ec: Bob Casselman
date: January 14, 2014

We are unable to support the subject zoning application enabling the inclusion of a health
‘club operation within an M1/industrial zoning planning area. We understand the proposed
Use is aligned to a resident market versus patrons of an existing industrial use within the

property.

‘The rationale for this position is based on the premise that retail/service and commercial
Uses are not compatible with production processing and warehousing applications
particularly within the same facility. Further, the presence of such uses, at least in some
cases, will deter investment attraction of potential industrial tenants within the subject,
plant site. We have accounts on record to validate this viewpoint.

(One final consideration isthe precedent that would be establish in providing futher
concessions for addtional retai/service businesses within the John G. Broome Park that
Could erode the integrity of the park's primary use. Industral clients tend to prefer usos
‘common to their own operation with the offering of value chain businesses that can
provide industrial service offerings to their supply chain.
