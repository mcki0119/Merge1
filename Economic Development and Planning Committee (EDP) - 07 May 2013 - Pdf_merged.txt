Financing Infrastructure

Generally municipalities have required
developers to provide or pay for onsite services
such as streets, street lighting, sidewalks, water
and wastewater and other public facilities within
the subdivision as a condition of subdivision
approval. The concept is that growth should pay
for itsetf. DC's apply to both residential and non-
residential development

Development Charges

DC's were introduced based on the principle that growth
should pay for itself.

New development creates new demands for (indirect)
infrastructure and these costs should be borne by those
benefitting as opposed to existing taxpayers (Stewart
Parkdale...)

se Existing taxpayers have already paid for “their” services

Development Charges

Purpose:

+ To recover the capital costs associated with
residential and non-residential growth within the
municipality

+ The capital costs are in addition to what (direct)
costs would normally be constructed as part ofa
subdivision (.. internal roads, sewers, watermains,
roads, sidewalks, steetights, etc.)

+ Municipalities are empowered to impose these
charges via the Development Charges Act (DCA)

Capital Cost definition has been broadened to

include:

+ Acquire land or intrest inland

+ improve tana

+ Acquire, lease, construct orimprove bung,
facities and structures (eludes furniture and

equipment)

Equipment and roling stack

Certain Capital Costs may not be included:

* Vehicle & Equipment with avg, life of <6 yrs.

+ Computer Equipment

DCA also provides for a mandatory 10%
reduction of capital cost for all services except:
+ Water, Wastewater and Stormwater Services
+ Roads and related services (i.e. Public Works)
+ Fire

+ Police

‘The planning horizon for future capital needs is
limited to 10 years forall services except:

+ Water, Wastewater and Stormwater Services
+ Roads and related services (ie. Public Works)
+ Fire

+ Police

Capital costs must be reduced by grants,
‘Subsidies and other contributions.

08 96/5643"

The calculation of the charge requires that
‘municipalities provide a ten year capital forecast and
that growth related assets are identified. The charge is
based on standards for services that are based on the
‘average of the previous ten years. (cannot enhance the
level of service through DC's, although they can expand
those services)

DC By-law last no more than 5 years and is subject to
public hearings

bee “unconditional” to be used for rehabilitation

purposes.

"Advantages of Development charges

Development Charges

Growth pays for itself and does not create a burden on
‘exiting taxpayers (Equitable in that the cost is being
borne by those benefitting from the development)
Development charges actually speeds up development
2s funding is available to pay for costs of growth related
development

Can provide some predictability for developers in that
rates are determined by By-Law

“Municipalities require a ten year capital forecast under
legislation

Frees up capital for infrastructure gap for strategic and

tactical assets

Espasy20ha?

Development Charges

Disadvantages include:
Increase in price of new construction

‘can be considered double taxation to new residents
(Those paying DC's are typically not yet taxpayers and
{do not have the right to “vote” whereas Taxpayers can
vote on or against the level of taxes.)

If not properly implemented, can lead to urban sprawl
Administrative burden and costs associated with it

Inhibit development (no empirical evidence to support)

The Impact of Development Charges

Considered a source of revenue as well as a planning
instrument. AS a source of revenue it recognizes the
Incidence of the charge (who bears the burden), the
impact on existing vs. new residents, the impact on
‘accountability and the impact on borrowing costs. As a
planning tool, it considers the impact of the charge on
land use and on the timing of developments.

Can lead to smart growth through policy and direction
to encourage compact growth.

6 ap55)8813°

Dt's as a planning tool.

Itis commonly understood that DC's are a fiscal tool to
help with the cost of new development. They can also be
utlized 2s a planning tool that can be used to concentrate
growth in identified areas and manners.

‘Municipalities have the right to wave DC's. Often for
rental accommodations where intensification has been
established. This is acceptable practice but the waived
fees cannot be raised by increasing other DC's

Council may choose to not collect development charges or to
‘exempt certain land use(s) or designated areas from
development charges. Such exemptions cannot be reflected
in the development charge calculations, as costs associated
with one land use cannot be transferred to other land uses,
thereby unfairly burdening lands with additional growth
‘elated costs. Any forgiveness must be funded by non-
development charge sources such as the general tax base.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ZONING BY-LAW 194-94 __M. PASCOE MERKLEY
119 — 121 JAMES STREET WEST DIRECTOR OF PLANNING
CITY OF BROCKVILLE ANDREW MCGINNIS
OWNER: HUSSAM (SAM) RAWAS PLANNER I
FILES: 014-163

RECOMMENDATION:

‘THAT Zoning By-law 194-94 be amended to rezone lands with municipal address 119 —
121 James Street West from R4 - General Residential Zone to R4 ~ General
Residential Special Exception Zone to establish site-specific provisions which would
Permit the semi-detached dwelling located on the property to be severed into two
Separate lots each containing one semi-detached dwelling unit.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations on an application for
‘amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-04 respecting the property at 119 —
121 James Street West.

BACKGROUND

Mr. Hussam (Sam) Rawas, owner of lands described as Lot 6, Block 35, Plan 67, City of
Brockville, County of Leeds, municipal address 119 — 121 James Street West (as
‘shown on Schedule “A”), has submitted an application for an amendment to Zoning
By-law 194-94 which would, if approved, rezone the subject lands to establish site-
specific provisions which would permit the semi-detached dwelling located on the
property to be severed to create two separate lots with one (1) residential unit on each
lot

Initia! discussions with Mr. Rawas started in 2010. He purchased the semi-detached
‘dwelling at 119-121 James Street West after a devastating fire. Mr. Rawas purchased
the semi-detached with stated intentions of adding an addition and reconstructing the
damaged dwellings. Upon Mr. Rawas visiting the Planning Department to discuss the
reconstruction, it was noted that the building was legally non-complying as it pertained
to multiple setbacks. It was explained to Mr. Rawas that the non-complying setbacks.
could not be reduced further (a sketch of the property prior to construction is attached
as Schedule “B"),

‘As construction proceeded, it was determined that the initial structure was unable to be
repaired and needed to be removed. Mr. Rawas proceeded to construct the front
portion of the building in approximately the original location, but with the rear addition
‘completed in an angular design to facilitate setback requirements,

Upon completion of the construction, Mr. Rawas came to the Planning Department
requesting a severance. It was explained that the property is drastically undersized for
his intant and that further approvals from Council would be required (a sketch of the
property post-construction with proposed severance line is attached as Schedule “C”)

ANALYSIS

Provincial Policy Considerations:

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2005 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Pianning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
consistent with’ the Provincial Policy Statement

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of potential
Provincial interest.

Section 1.1.3.1 states that “Settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and their
Vitality and regeneration shall be promoted’,

Section 1.1.3.2 states that "Land use pattems within settlement areas shall be based
on:
2. densities and a mix of land uses which:
a, efficiently use land and resources;
. are appropriate for, and efficiently use, the infrastructure and public
service facilties which are planned or available, and avold the need
{or their unjustified and/or uneconomical expansion; and
c. minimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, and
promote energy efficiency in accordance with policy 1.8; and
b. a range of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
‘accordance with the criteria in policy 1.1.3.3."

Section 1.1.3.3 states that "Planning Authorities shall identify and promote opportunities
for intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated taking into
account existing building stock or areas, including Brownfield sites, and the availabilty
Of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilties required to
‘accommodate projected needs.”

Section 1.4.3 states, among others, that "Planning authorities shall provide for an
‘appropriate range of housing types and densities to moet projected requirements of
current and future residents of the regional market area by:
b.-Permiting and facitting:
all forms of housing required to meet social, health and well-being
requirements of current and future residents; and,
2. all forms of residential intensification and redevelopment in
‘accordance with policy 1.1.3.3

d. Promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources,
infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of
alternative transportation modes and public transit in areas where if exists
or is to be developed.

Section 1.6.5.4 speaks to a land use pattern, density and mix of uses that minimize the
number of vehicle trips and supports the development of viable choices and plans for
public transit and other alternative transportation modes.

‘The overall proposal represents intensification and revitalization of the existing land
stock within close proximity to the Downtown core. No change to existing municipal
Infrastructure will be needed. The proposal will add to the mix of housing types within
the area and allow for residents to select alternative means of transportation should the
residents choose as they are within close proximity of the Red Bus route and the Brock
Trail

Official Pian Considerations

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
growth, development, and change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Pian designates the subject property as "Neighbourhood Area’
The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,

that Is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned,

Section 2.3 outlines strategic planning themes which includes
and Vital City’, "An Economically Strong and Diverse City’,
Services and Amenities”, and “A Well-Planned Responsive City’

‘Sustainable, Healthy,
High Quality of City

The proposed intensification achieves the above objectives. The proposal legally
intensifies an existing, serviced lot within the urban area; and, is located within walking
distance of a number of amenities, services, and recreational faciities that meet
residents’ dally needs.

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. More specifically,
Sections 32.41 and 32.43 outine policies for the scope of development within
"Neighbourhood Areas" as focusing on low to medium density housing, infiling on
existing lots of record and the rounding-out of existing development patterns while
ensuring that the character of the neighbourhoods is preserved. More specifically
various forms of residential intensification such as infiling and the creation of accessory
dwelling units are to be encouraged, where appropriate. These general Neighbourhood

Area policies are further refined under Section 3.2.4.3 wherein small scale residential
intensification is permitted in all Neighborhood Areas where infrastructure Is adequate
and where there are no significant physical constraints,

The proposed development satisfies all the criteria required within the Official Plan.
Change to the building footprint has occurred through reconstruction/repair of the
dwelling and due to the building already being in place, there will be little to no impact
‘on adjacent property owners.

ning B ions

The current zoning on the property with municipal addrtess 119 - 121 James Street
West is R4 — General Residential Zone under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94,
as amended.

The requested Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 would, if
approved, rezone the subject lands to permit a semi-detached dwelling currently located
‘on the property to be severed into two separate lots with one residential unit on each.
In considering the proposed zoning change, the following items were considered:

1. Lot Area and Frontage:

Zoning by-law 194-94 requires a minimum lot area of 270.0 m? (2,906.3 ft?) for a
‘semi-detached dwelling and a minimum lot frontage of 9.0 metres (29.5 feet) for each
Unitot. The proposed amendment is requesting reductions to these minimums. The
lot frontage for the severed lands is proposed to, be reduced by 47.8% (4.31 metres
or 14.1 feet) and the lot area by 41.8% (112.8 m? or 1,214.2 ft’). The lot frontage for
the retained lands is proposed to be reduced by 16.7% (1.51 metres or 4.95 feet) and
the lot area by 36.9% (09.6 m? or 1,072.1 ft)

‘The requests proposed are significant decreases to the minimum requirements.
‘Accordingly an application for minor variance was deemed to be inappropriate.
However, the proposal represents intensification which is consistent with the Official
Plan, and the Provincial Policy Statement.

2. Lot Setbacks:
Zoning by-law 194-94 requires that a minimum interior side yard setback of 1.5
metres (5.0 feet) be followed with the exception of existing structures where legal
non-complying status exists.

‘The initial building was constructed on or around 1900. After a fire in 2010, and

rnon-complying setbacks was reduced further than previously existed or permitted
Mr. Rawas, is therefore requesting through this rezoning application that 2 minimum
interior side yard of 0.0 metres (0.0 feet for the proposed severed lands be granted
from the western property line. Schedule “C” to this report identifies the various
potions ofthe existing bullding that encroach onto the abutting property. The Zoning
By-law cannot recognize portions of a building which lie beyond the limits of the
property.

‘An agreement with the Neighbouring property has been signed and registered at the
Registry Office in relation to the encroachment and the terms of the use of the
existing driveway on the west.

Reductions of various zone provisions are one of the effects of residential
intensification in an older area developed well before the establishment of current
Zone provisions for development. Regardless of the success of the application for
rezoning, the setbacks currently being applied for exist and cannot be changed
without removal of part or all ofthe existing structure. Accordingly, itis reasonable to
recognize the existing conditions in a new site specific zone.

‘Should the recommendations above be accepted by Council, the zone would read
similar to the following:

"R4X2-10

The uses permitted in the R4-X2-10 Zone shall be those permitted in the R4
General Residential Zone.

The zone provisions for the R4-X2-10 Zone shail be the same as for the R4

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

‘As noted in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed amendment to Zoning By-
law 194-94 for 119 ~ 121 James Street West is consistent with the PPS and with the
relevant policies of the City's Official Plan.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with the requested rezoning of the subject property are the
responsibilty of the Owner.

‘Should the request for establishment of a special exception zone be approved,
‘consideration of a concurrent application for consent to sever will proceed. With a land
severance, MPAC will adjust the current value assessment which potentially will alter
the taxation generated from the property, when it becomes two (2) separate lots.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for zoning amendment for 119 ~ 121 James Street West, it is,
reasonable to amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to permit the semi-
detached dwelling located on the property to be severed into two separate lots each
containing a dwelling unit with special exceptions as set out in the recommendation at
the beginning of this report and as noted in the proposed site specific zoning including
in this report.

vi licy Statement Consider

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2005 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Pianning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
Consistent with’ the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial
interest. Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under
consideration, and thus, only those relevant portions will be referenced below.

Section 1 Building Strong Communities, addresses a range of planning considerations
with which to encourage a strong community. Among these considerations are
managing and directing land use to achieve efficient development and land use
patterns, use of existing infrastructure and service facilities, and transportation corridors,

243 Pertth Street is an older existing brick building within the limits of the City of
Brockville, is fully serviced with municipal services and adjacent to the Blue Bus Route.
In recent 'years the building has been extensively renovated and made barrier free
accessible from the exterior. This work has been done on behalf of the current owner to
accommodate the current use of the building. The proposed addition of a clinic as
secondary use to the prime use, being a psychotherapy training centre, is consistent
with policies of the PPS.

Official Plan Considerations

The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
‘growth, development and change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Plan designates the subject property as “Institutional Area’.

The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned.

Section 4.8.2 Permitted Uses, within the Institutional Area, specifically identifies
institutional uses as including, among other uses, clinics and treatment facilities. The
current use in 243 Perth Street, being the "Centre for Rational and Cognitive Therapies,
an Albert Ells Institute affilated training centre", is consistent with the Official Plan and
‘goes $0 far as to include a clinic within the permitted uses.

Owners: AG. Ahmed

File: D14-162

Accordingly, no change to the Official Plan is required to address adding a “Clinic” as an
‘additional permitted use in the zone applicable to the property.

Zoning By-law Considerations:

243 Perth Street is currently zoned as I1-General Institutional Zone under City of
Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94, as amended,

‘The proposed Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 would, if
‘approved, permit a “Clinic” in additional to those uses currently permitted under the I1-
General Institutional Zone.

‘The Zoning By-law does not identify a “clinic” within the permitted uses listed under the
|1- General Institutional Zone. The 1-General Institutional Zone permits the following
uses: a manse to a church, church, day nursery, hospital, nursing home, school, and a
vocational training centre, all of which are traditionally non-commercial uses and which
are consistent with the term “institutional”

The Zoning By-law as currently structured identifies a “clinic” as being a permitted use
under a range of commercial zones. A clinic in this case being a stand-alone
commercial business.

Details of the clinical operation have been provided by the applicant, and the use is
described as follows:

“The request to include clinical services at the Centre for Rationale and
Cognitive Therapies is to enhance the educational program by offering on site
‘supervision fo clinicians who wish to advance their therapeutic skills. The
Centre would be able to offer extended clinical placement for graduate students
thereby introducing new professionals to the City of Brockville.” And

The addition of clinical services in mental health would result in the opportunity
to have 7 new mental health professionals establish private practices in
Brockville. The Centre has had inquiries from a psychiatrist, social worker and
Psychologist who are considering relocating to Brockville and who are
‘Specifically interested in private practice at the Centre.”

Accordingly, the introduction of a clinic into the I1-General Institutional Zone is
recommended, as a step towards the integration of those policies approved on 09
February 2012 in the Official Plan.

‘The zoning proposed for 243 Perth Street, shouid this recommendation be endorsed,
would read as follows:

“1-X5-2 -General institutional Special Exception Zone

In addition to those uses permitted in an I1-General Institutional Zone, a
linc shall be permitted.”
Is ne Publi
1. Hours of Operatior
Clarification on hours of operation was requested. AG. Ahmed confirmed

that the clinic will be operated during regular office hours. Exceptions will be
‘occasioned by seminars and similar events,

2. Clients:

Clients will be treated on an out-patient basis only with no overnight stays.
‘The nature of client needs is a wide range. However, the Owner has stated
that there is no intention to operate the clinic as a methodone clinic. The clinic
is to be operated as an accessory use to the main use being the “Centre for
Rational and Cognitive Therapies’. The training centre Is in need of a facility
lunder which practical experience can be undertaken by students of the
Centre and for clinical space to expand the overall services of the facility.

3. Parking:

A total of fiteen (15) parking spaces are available on-site. This meets the
everyday needs of the facility and is sufficient to meet the requirements of the
Zoning By-law. Off-site parking is required periodically to respond to events,
such as seminars. This parking will be street parking as per the City Street
Parking regulations and parking as can be found by participants

4, Security:

Specialized security is not required for the psychotherapy training centre or
for the proposed clinic.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

As stated in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed rezoning of 243 Perth
Street is consistent with the PPS and the new Official Plan for the City of Brockville.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with the proposed clinic use are the responsibilty of the Owner.

I is unknown whether the establishment of a clinic within this building would attract a
change in current value assessment and thus a change in municipal property taxes
payable.

CONCLUSION
Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for zoning amendment for 243 Perth Street, itis reasonable to

‘amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to allow the addition of @ “Clinic” to
those uses currently permitted under the I1-General Institutional Zone.
