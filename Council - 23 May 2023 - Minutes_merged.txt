His Worship congratulated the Aquatarium staff, and all those involved, in bringing
the Travelling Bricks LEGO exhibit to the Brockville Centennial Youth Arena; this is
the first time this exhibit has been displayed in Canada. His worshiped encouraged
people to attend the event, noting how impressive it is. Additionally, City Staff,
Who have worked hard to make the facility ready for use, were thanked. Tickets
can be ordered online at travellingbricksbrockville.com.

Mayor Wren recognized the paramedics of Leeds and Grenville for their service and
hard work, as this week is National Paramedic Week. All first responders were
thanked for keeping us safe.

His Worship addressed the Integrity Commissioner report from the last few week:

Donations made to the City of Brockville, that are designated towards specific
projects, have been and always will be used for their intended purpose. Donations
are not arbitrarily spent on city operations, except when they are designated for
such. The spending decisions about donations are not made by City staff, but by
City Council as a whole, not any individual member. His Worship assured those
who have donated, or will donate in the future, that those funds are clearly
identified, safeguarded and spent carefully based on the intentions of the donor,
and only when the proper pracess is followed.

‘The City's Procurement Policy is in line with that of all other municipalities in the
province of Ontario. The policy is rigid for good reason, Follow up from the Tunnel
Project led to a review from KPMG, which resulted in the Procurement Policy being
updated in the last term of Council. It is staff of the City of Brockville who operate
within the framework of these policies; policies which were established and
approved by this elected body.

Regarding the process for handling complaints, municipalities are required by law
to appoint an Integrity Commissioner. That individual is an independent and
impartial adjudicator to which matters of complaint are referred. The only role for
the Mayor, City Manager, and City Clerk to play, at the beginning of the process, is
to determine if a complaint is vexatious or frivolous. They are not meant to
perform their own adjudication or evaluate whether the complaint should be
Feferred to the Integrity Commissioner; that would be impeding the process.
Council did not create the system in place, but they are required to follow it, and,
as needed, that is what they will do.
