RECOMMENDATION

THAT Zoning By-law 050-2014 be amended to rezone lands described as Part of Lot 4,
Registered Plan 80, being Part 3 on Reference Plan 28R-6942, City of Brockville,
County of Leeds from R2-General Residential Zone to OS-4 Open Space Special
Exception Zone to allow for a lot with an area of 84 m?; with the use of the lands to be
restricted to a Private Marine Facility only and with provisions prohibiting the
construction of buildings, accessory uses, and limiting boat, trailer and recreational
vehicle parking. For purposes of the OS-4 Zone, a Private Marine Facility means a
structure which is used to moor or berth a boat, and includes only a dock, boat lit,
boatport or slip.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations on an application for
amendment to City of Brockvile Zoning By-law 050-2015 respecting the property
described as Part of Lot 4, Registered Plan 80, being Part 3 on Reference Plan 26R-
6942, City of Brockville, County of Leeds; Bayview Road

BACKGROUND

‘The owners of a small, vacant parcel of land, legally described as Part of Lot 4,
Registered Plan 80, being Parts 1, 2, and 3 on Reference Plan 28R-6942, City of
Brockville, County of Leeds, located on the south side of Bayview Road (private road),
have, through their agent, Mr. Michael Menard, fled applications for a Consent to Sever
under File 802/16, and for an amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014 under File D14-
012,

‘The entire property was acquired by the current owners in May of 2006 as a waterfront
parcel together with a boat hoist and paved parking

File: D14-12en9

A portion of the lands (Parts 1 and 2 on Reference Plan 28R-6942) is proposed to be
‘added to the abutting property at 5 Bayview Road through the Application for Consent.
However, this action would lead to the creation of a remnant, undersized parcel (Part 3
‘on Reference Plan 28R-6942) approximately 84 sq. m. in area which does not conform
to the minimum lot size requirements established under City of Brockville Zoning By-law
050-2014.

‘Thus, concurrent with the application for Consent to Sever, the applicant has applied to
cchange the zoning on what is proposed to become the remnant portion of the owners’
lands (Part 3 on Reference Plan 28R-6942), from R2-Single Detached Residential to
‘OS-Open Space Special Exception Zone to allow for a lot with an area of 84 m?. The
OS-Open Space Special Exception Zone would also restrict the use of this small,
remnant parcel to a Private Marine Facility only.

‘The following schedules are attached to this report:

zoning of the parcel and surrounding lands.

2. Schedule “B” - a plan of the subject lands, and illustrates the intention to sever

CRCA Staff have no objection to the approval of Consent Application BO2/16 and
Application for Zoning By-law Amendment D14-012 based on their consideration
for natural hazard, natural heritage, and water quality and quantity protection
policies.

In response to contact made by a number of neighbours, there will be a review of
‘compliance matters with regards to the boat hoist location, Regardless, support
for the applications for Consent and Rezoning remain the same,

Investigation of compliance status of existing boat hoist and dock completed.
Original marine facilty structure was constructed long before CRCA regulated in-
‘water work. In 2009, the structure was extended further into the St. Lawrence
River. There is no record of a permit. A review of the existing structure reveals
that, ifan application were made for the same structure at present, a permit could
be issued as it is consistent with CRCA Guidelines (see Schedule “F")

6. Neighbour

‘Submission received May 26, 2016. Background information provided respecting
the subject lands which were originally part of this neighbour's property. A right of
access was retained. Questions how the land could have been zoned residential,

by a covered structure such as a boathouse. Concerns that his right of way to

7. Neighbour

Parts 1 and 2 should be completely de-linked. Proposal has considerable
financial implications to the owner of 5 Bayview Road. Rezoning of Part 3 will
have considerable consequences for the neighbourhood i.e. Bayview Road over
which the City of Brockville has absolutely no control,

8 Neighbour

‘Ownership of the property by a Bayview Road resident is desirable. The physical
dimensions of the property are not consistent with R2.zoning requirements and
the zoning needs to be changed to reflect the property use. Would be in favour
of the rezoning to OS Open Space with the removal ofthe clause permitting a
boat launch ramp, boathouse, unenclosed rooftop deck, boat port or boat slip,
but would agree to permit a dock with boat lift only

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

This application seeks to create an OS Open Space Special Exception Zone affecting a
very small portion of waterfront land on Bayview Road. The subject lands are what will
become a remnant parcel of St. Lawrence riverfront created following a Consent to
sever adjacent lands which are to be added to 5 Bayview Road. Its current use is as
access to a dock, and no plans which would change this use were submitted with the
‘application.

A review will be conducted of relevant Provincial land use policies, relevant Official Plan
policies, and with consideration to the nature of appropriate land use and zoning
controls to be applied in this instance. The input received will also be reviewed.

Provincial Policy Consideration

The Provincial Policy Statement 2014 (PPS) issued under Section 3 of the Ontario
Planning Act provides policy direction on matters of Provincial interest related to land
use planning and development. Section 3 of the Planning Act further directs that
Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be consistent with” the Provincial
Policy Statement

Part V of the PPS contains various policies under the headings “Bullding Strong Healthy
Communities", "Wise Use and Management of Resources", and “Protecting Public
Health and Safety’. Only a few policies would be relevant to this matter.

To be considered is Policy 1.1.1 c) which states that “healthy, liveable and safe
‘communites are sustained by avoiding development and land use pattems which may
cause environmental or public health and safety concems.”

Also, on the theme of Protecting Public Health and Safety around natural hazards,
Policy 3.1.1 a) speaks to directing development “to areas outside of hazardous lands
adjacent to the shorelines of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River System...to avoid
flooding or erosion hazards.”

Through planning tools available to the municipality, land use can be controlled, and
inappropriate development can be avoided. Zoning offers the best opportunity to
implement such control. Very restrictive language, limiting the opportunity for use of the
subject parcel, imposed through a special, site-specific zoning, can ensure that the
Provincial interests around appropriate development, avoiding potential environmental
oF public health and safety concems, and avoidance of flooding or erosion hazards can

be achieved.

‘These Provincial policies also factor into the the review of this application by the CRCA,
and reflect that organization's interest in avoidance of natural hazards, protection of
water quality and ecological integrity, in line with the objectives stated in the PPS. The
CRCA supports the imposition of an OS-Open Space Special Exception Zone which is
suitable for shoreline access and marine facilities but would prohibit other unsuitable
land uses.

Therefore, it can be said that the imposition of restrictive zoning in the nature of the
request being sought is consistent with the PPS.

Official Plan Considerations

The Official Plan provides guidance on how to manage future growth, development and
change within the City of Brockville

‘The subject property is designated under Schedule 1 ~ City Structure, of the Oficial
Plan, as “Neighbourhood Area” and is within the Cataraqui Region Conservation
Authority screening area,

Policies in the Official Plan seek to protect the stability of established neighbourhoods.
‘Specifically, Policy 3.2.4.1.1. of the Official Plan states that the character and identity of
existing neighbourhoods is to be sustained and enhanced,

Section 4.3 of the Official Plan sets out policies to be applied to lands designated
Neighbourhood Area, This land use designation establishes that residential uses are to
predominate. Accessory uses thereto are also permitted. Given the neighbourhood's
location on the St. Lawrence River, itis common and reasonable to expect boat docking
as an accessory use.

Policies in Section 4.3 also state that under circumstances where there may an
‘opportunity for intensification or redevelopment, the character of a neighbourhood is to
be preserved. Clearly, this is not a circumstance where there is opportunity for
intensification or redevelopment. The small parcel owned by the current owners was
split from a main residential use many years ago in the days prior to the implementation
(of subdivision control in the Province of Ontario through the Planning Act. A waterfront
parcel with docking was created apparently for the sole purpose of a previous owner's
interest in retaining water access. The parcel as it currently exists is significantly
undersized and has no other utility than as the land to which a dock is attached,

Today, not only does the Planning Act give the City authority to control the subdivision
of land, we also have policies in Section 6 of the Official Plan that guide us with respect,
to lot creation, to ensure that new lots are appropriately sized to be adequate for

existing and proposed uses. The Offical Plan also recognizes, however, that there are
times when severances for technical or legal purposes need to be considered.
Specifically, Section 6.4.5.2.2 states that lots that are the subject of this type of
‘application shall comply with the specifications set out in the zoning by-law, and if not,
the zoning by-law must be amended or a minor variance granted. In this case, there is
‘a need to amend the zoning by-law to establish an appropriate zone for the very small,
remnant portion which will be created once Parts 1 and 2 are added to the adjoining
neighbour's property at 5 Bayview Road.

‘The Official Plan contemplates these uncommon local circumstances, and suggests that
proceeding with a consent to sever while also establishing zoning controls is
appropriate.

Itis also recognized in the Official Plan that there are natural heritage considerations for
waterfront locations, and such lands fall within the screening area for the Cataraqui
Region Conservation Authority. The CRCA shares our concem with ensuring the
avoidance of natural hazards such as flooding and erosion, and protection of the
‘ecological integrity of the river and shoreline. Comments provided by the CRCA are
‘supportive of the implementation of limits on the use of these waterfront lands.

Zoning By-law Considerations

The subject lands are currently zoned R2-General Residential Zone. The applicant has
submitted an application for consent to sever a portion of the owners’ lands to be added
to adjacent lands and to rezone the remnant portion to an OS ~ Open Space Special
Exception Zone, permitting a small lot 84 sq. m. in area which would be restricted in use
to a Private Marine Facilty only. A Private Marine Facility is currently defined in Zoning
By-law 050-2014 as follows:

“Marine Facility, Private, means an accessory building or structure which is
used to place a boat into or out of a water body, or is used to moor, berth or store
‘a boat. This definition includes a boat launching ramp, boat lif, dock, boathouse,
boatport or slip. However, this definition shall not include any building used for
‘human habitation nor any marina or marina sales and service station, but may
include an unenciosed rooftop deck on a boathouse.

In determining whether this requested zoning is appropriate, there are several factors to
be considered, including: 1. the characteristics of this small waterfront parcel; 2. the
inappropriateness of the current R2 Zone; and 3. the best alternate zone, giving
‘consideration to all input received.

‘The subject property has been previously described as a very small waterfront parcel of
only 84 sq. m. The photos altached as Schedules C1 and C2 as well as others
‘supplied by neighbours indicate that the parcel in question is nothing more than a small,

relatively level paved area adjacent to the shoreline to which a dock and former boat
hoist/existing seating platform are attached. The St. Lawrence River frontage is
approximately 7.5 m, while frontage on Bayview Road would be approximately 5.2 m.

The existing zoning is R2-Single Detached Residential. The uses permitted in the R2
Zone are: single detached dwelling; group home dwelling; converted dwelling; bed and
breakfast; second suite; and garden suite. None of these uses exist on the site, nor
would there be any opportunity to develop any of the uses permitted under the current
Zoning, given the size of the site. Furthermore, the minimum lot area and minimum lot
frontage for lots to be created in the R2 Zone is 425 sq. m, and 17 m respectively. It is
clear that the existing residential zone is not representative of uses which exist or could
be considered for these lands.

Given the above, the best option is to determine the most appropriate alternate zone to
be applied to the subject property. The application seeks an OS Open Space Special
Exception Zone, recognizing the lot area of 84 sq. m. and with use limited to a Private
Marine Facility. ‘It is appropriate to be very restrictive when it comes to the use of these
lands, and creating a site specific OS Open Space Zone is the best approach, )

However, considering the limitations of the site, the input received, and the concems
‘expressed by several neighbours, itis recommended that, for purposes of this parcel, a
Private Marine Facility be permitted, but that a modified definition of Private Marine
Facility be implemented in this instance,

Also, some of the general provisions set out in Zoning By-law 050-2014 are not
rnecessatily appropriate. Section 3.35 establishes general provisions for Private Marine
Facilities and Marinas, and Section 3.47 deals with Trailers, Recreational Vehicles and
Boat Parking and Storage. Excerpts from these Sections are reproduced below:

“3.95. PRIVATE MARINE FACILITIES AND MARINAS

2) General

y) use a boat, trailer or recreational type vehicle for human habitation unless

To capture the appropriate control over use of the subject parcel, itis recommended
that the following new special exception zone be implemented on Part 3 of Reference
Plan 28R-6942, replacing the current R2 Zone, and establishing control over
construction of buildings, accessory uses, and boat, trailer and recreational vehicle
parking:

"OS-4 Zone
Notwithstanding Section 3.35 of Zoning By-law 050-2014, the uses permitted in

the OS-4 Zone shail be restricted to a Private Marine Facility only. For purposes
of the OS-4 Zone, a Private Marine Facilty shall mean a structure which is used

to moor or berth a boat, and includes only a dock, boat lift, boatport or slip.
Only the following zone provision applies fo the OS-4 Zone:
[64 nF

‘No buildings are permitted, nor are accessory uses, buildings or structures
permitted.

[Minimum Lot Area

‘A Private Marine Facilty is subject to approval or permit from the Conservation
‘Authority, the Province of Ontario or the Government of Canada.

‘Notwithstanding Section 3.47, no person shall store or park more than one (1)
boat or trailer, nor park a recreational type vehicle, nor use a boat, trailer or
recreational type vehicle for human habitation in the OS-4 Zone.”

Even with the implementation of the above recommended zone which emanates from
‘consideration of all input and the analysis of the request for a site-specific zoning, it
should be recognized that zoning on waterfront parcels exerts authority to control the
use of the land only, while it is the CRCA's authority over in-water and shoreline
undertakings that controls elements beyond the shore. As a result, zoning cannot
control all potential change in waterfront neighbourhoods.

Dear Ms. Bagnell

Re: Application for Consent BO2/16
‘Application for Zoning By-law Amendment D14-012 (050-2014)
Lot 16, Con. 1; 5 Bayview Road and Vacant Parcel East of § Bayview Road
‘Assessinent Roll # 080203005533300 & 080203005535200
City of Brockville
‘Waterbody: St. Lawrence River,

Staff of the Cataragui Region Conservatiin Authority (CRCA) have reviewed the above-noted
applications for consent and zoning by-law amendment, and provide the following comments forthe
City of Brockville's consideration

Proposal
‘The proposal involves the severance of an approximately 110.7 m? portion of vacant land currently
used for parking fiom an existing 195.4 m* (approx. vacant lot and the addition of the severed
Portion to an adjacent 1,104 m?(approx.) residential lotto the south (5 Bayview Ra). The lotto be
retained would be approximately 84.6 min size and would remain in is curent use.

‘The retained lot is also subject to proposed zoning amendment that seeks to change the subject
zoning from “R2-Single Detached Residential” to site-specific ‘OS-Open Space’. The amendment
‘will better reflect the use of this land as an undersized parcel with shoreline access right-of-way and
‘marine facility (dock) The zoning change would limit the us to a private marine facility with human
habitation prohibited,

‘These applications are mainly administrative in nature with the intent being to formally join the land
to be severed to 5 Bayview Road to allow continued parking us and also to rezone the land
‘to match its actual use.

Site Description
‘The subject lands are located between Bayview Road and the St. Lawrence River in the west end of
the City of Brockville. The lot subject to the severance (adjacent to 5 Bayview Road) has roughly 13
m of frontage onthe rive. Ths lot is“ shaped and consists of asphalt and grass with outeropning
bedrock. There isan existing dock on the lot and the parcel is subject to a right-of-way’ for shoreline
access. The lotto receive the adltion is curently developed with a single-family dwelling. This lot
is mainly exposed bedrock with varied topography.

Discussion
‘The main interests ofthe CRCA in this application are the avoidance of natural hazards (flooding,
crosion and ioe damage) associated with the St. Lawrence River and the protection of the water
‘quality and ecological integrity of the river and shoreline,

The CRCA regulates development and site alteration through our implementation of Ontario
Regulation 14/06: Development, Interference with Wetlands & Alterations to Shorelines and
Watercourses for ands located within and adjacent to natural hazard areas.

‘The CRCA defines the extent of natural hazards associated withthe St, Lawrence River shoreline 2s
the ‘regulatory flood plan’ and the ‘erosion hazard limit. The extent ofthese hazard areas occupies
«substantial portion ofthe subject lands, including the vacant lot and 5 Bayview Road.

Through O. Reg. 148/06, development is generally restricted within and adjacent to the regulatory
‘ood plain and erosion hazard limit. We note however, thatthe existing development at the subject
lands, including the marin facility (dock) atthe vacant fot and the residential dwelling at 5 Bayview
‘Road, is compliant with the CRCA's regulatory requirements and/or is grandfithored due tothe date
‘of construction

Since the proposed consent application is intended to formally enlarge the existing residential lot in
onder to allow parking and does not involve any new dovelopment on the subject lands, CRCA.stafP
do not anticipate new or exacerbated natural hazard risks. We note that the existing vacant lot is
heavily constrained and does not represent viable opportunities for inland development. The
proposed severance and lot addition will not change this situation,

‘Stuff support the proposed zoning by-law amendment from natural hazards and waterbody
protection perspective since the change toa site specifie Open Space zone wil formally limit uses on
the retained parcel to those which it is suited for, specifically: shoreline access and marine facilities
excluding human habitation

Recommendation
‘Staff have no objection to the approval of application for consent BO2/I6 aad application for zoning
by-law amendment D14-012 based on our consideration for natural hazard, natural heritage, and
water quality and quantity protection policies,

Ontario Regulation 148/06
‘As discussed, the CRCA has a Regulation controling Development, Interference with Wetlands, and
Alteration to Shorelines and Watercourses (Ontario Regulation 148/06), made pursuant to Section
28 of the Conservation Authorities Act. Permission under Ontario Regulation 148/06 is required

Subject: ‘Bayview Road - Marine Facility

Maureen,

CCRCA staff have been investigating the compliance status ofa marine facility (Le, boat host and dock) located on the
water offshore from a vacant parcel of land on Bayview Road (Assessment Rolif 080203005533200). We have found no
records of permits issued under the CRCN's regulation - Ontario Regulation 148/06: Development, Interference with
Wetlands & Alterations to Shorelines and Watercourse, pursuant to Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act.
From information obtained from other partis as wel as from our review of avalabe aerial Imagery, evidence suggests
thatthe original marine facility structure was constructed long before the CRCA regulated in-water work via O. Reg.
|M48/06. The original structure is therefore “grandfathered” from the perspective of our regulation.

nour investigation we also became aware that the structure had been moved (extended further into the St. Lawrence
River) at some point in 2009. This has been confirmed by the current landowner. According to the landowner, the
‘extension/relocation occurred under an understanding from a contractor and legal counsel that permit approvals from
the CRCA under O. Reg. 148/06 were not required atthe time. In fact, our regulation did apply in 2009 and the
‘modification in locaton would have been subject to permit approval at that time.

‘Due to regulatory changes, the CRCA adopted a Statute of Limitations policy that limits our enforcement of O. Reg.
148/06 to work that has occured post 2010. As suc, the change in location of the marine facility that occurred in 2009
{snot subject to retroactive permit approval nor any other compliance requirement enforceable by the CRCA.

Having reviewed the existing structure, including its design and configuration, CRCA staff can confirm that the structure
is consistent with the CRCA's Guidelines for implementation of ©. Reg. 148/06 given the property constraints. tis our
pinion that, fan application were made for the same structure at present, thatthe design and location would comply
‘with our guidelines and a permit could be isued under 0. Reg. 148/06, We cannot speak to compliance status with
regards to any other applicable regulation, by-law, of legislation,

| trust this information serves as @ useful update ast relates tothe status of the marine facility atthe subject property :
‘Should you have any questions, please donot hesitate to contact me.

| woul ke toast speak atthe public meoting Tuesday June 7, 2016 at 6:00 pm

‘The following is information that | have been told, encountered or researched and at the
time ofthis writing believe to be true and would like you to know as background
information before the meeting.

‘+ The above lot used to be part ofthe property of 6 Bayview Road, A past owner
severed the parts above so that he could build a boat hoist with a ramp
(gangplank) leading out to it and have access to the river. He then sold the
original parcel of land with the house, but retained the section referenced above,
6 Bayview Road had deeded acooss to the river.

‘+ This owner recognized that 6 Baview had the right to access the river. (please
see attached letter). The hoist blocked one from doing so but the right of way
‘Was never an issue as the owners and residents of 6 Bayview were always
allowed to go on, aver and tie up boats to the gangplank and boat hoist.

‘+The present owners of the above referenced property knew of the right of way
before they bought it The first time I came to my property after they had bought
it was met with a work trailer parked over my deeded access and an owner
sitting on a lawn chair reading on the access,

‘+ Lwentto a lawyer and an official request by him was given to remove the
blockages. | was told not to touch the hoist so | had no access to the river so my
lawyer went ahead to try to resolve tho issue to one that was fair to me by issuing
‘a statement of claim. One of the proposals made by them was to extend the
hoist out by about 15 feet to the south. Emails were exchanged but no
agreement was ever signed. I was assured that before anything could be done.
all the proper permits would have to be done, authorities notified (MNR) and all
residents affected would have to be consulted with.

+ | was absolutely shocked fo get a phone call one moming that the hoist (now |
believe a deck) was being moved out to the river and the gangplank extended,
‘Myself the owner of § Bayviow and 4 Bayview had no idea that this was to
happen. | contacted the MINR, the CRCA, and the City of Broclaille and all sac it

‘was not their concem. | guess I now had some sort right of access to the rive
but never agreed to by me.
Question:
How can this tiny parcol of land severed off to have parking and access to a boat holst
>be zoned residential?


Page 27 of 126

‘As of now | object to the proposed by law change for the following reasons:

1) My view ofthe river would be blocked by a covered structure such as a boat
house. ‘As of right now | can see the river from my property.

2) On such a small piace of land and with myself having a six foot right of way, a
structure such as a dock or boathouso and a boat tiod to the side, | do not see
‘how my right of way tothe river could be respected.

3) The present owners through thelr past actions have shown that my rights are not
‘considered. | have included pictures of my access to the river around the hoist
and the way they presently maintain my deeded access to the water.

Subject property: Part of Lot 4, Plan 80, being Parts 1,2,and 3, Reference Plan

Rezoning R2 Single Detached Residential to OS-Open Space Special Exception
Zone.
Assuming the following provisos:
‘+ Ownership of the property(s) by a Bayview Road resident(s) is desirable,
+ I understand that the currently proposed subdivision would result in Part 2
& 2 being purchased by the owner of 5 Bayview Road and become part of
that residential property (already used as a driveway & parking area) & Part
3 being purchased by the owner of 8 Bayview Road for use as a dock /
water access.
© The physical dimensions of the property are not consistent with R2 Single
Detached Residential zoning requirements & the zoning needs to be
changed to reflect the property use.
| would be in favor ofthis re-zoning proposal with removal of the clause
permitting a boat launch ramp, boathouse, unenclosed rooftop deck, boat port or
boat slip. For further clarification | would agree to the following: The OS-Open
Space Special Exception Zone would allow for a lot of 84 square meters and
restricting its use to Private Marine Facllity Only, permitting a dock with boat lft
only. Buildings for human habitation, marina or marina sales and service would
not be permitted. A boathouse, boat launch ramp, boat port or boat slip would
not be permitted.

Re: Public Meeting Tuesday June 7", 2016 at 6 PM.

Notes for committee Perusal:
EEE wilt the boat hoist several years ago
to access his island across from St. Lawrence Park. Since
donated by him to the City. In existence for 40 - 50 years as a
ramp to a mechanized boat hoist.

I personally have access to numerous Color & Black & white
photos of this property over the years

My Mother and Father purchased [Bayview Road in 1982.

My father has passed away but my mother still lives here 34
years later.

She will be 92 years of age this September and has a chair
lift at [J Bayview.

We have arranged for her to move to Maitland to be near
my wife and our waterfront home. She will have everything
on 1 level.

As a consequence of this zoning application we are unable to
put her property on the market because of the uncertainty of
the outcome of this application. Buyers want to know what
that sign is all about.

After talking to the residents of Bayview Road I have found
unanimous objection to this zoning proposal from 11
Residents.

Page 49 of 126

2.

There are 14 Residents on the street and of the remaining
three IE have been travelling in Europe
for weeks. Before leaving they said they were in opposition
to the proposal but were gone before they could sign.
Apparently they are to return home on the 5" of June and I
am sure, knowing them well, they will be attending the

meeting. EEE went away last week and he gave me

An email address to send to him, which I did but have not
received a reply.

The last residen(: A of Bayview

Who recently purchased their home are apparently involved
in a proposed sale of the subject property when the zoning
issue is resolved. Interestingly, when he spoke to me last
week re: river property he said he only wanted the property
for a boat hoist for his 17° fishing boat and that was all.

May 29", 2016 at 9 AM I was approached by

an: of the owners of the subject property, He
knew I was talking to the residents on the road about their
concerns. I told him there is almost 100 % opposition to his
proposal, I told him that there were concerns about the list
of potential uses for the property with the new zoning. I told
him there was a concensus that could be possibly be reached
where the residents would have no objection to having the
property for a Boat Hoist use only. He did acknowledge he


Page 50 of 126

3.

is selling the property to I of Bayview Road

Twas a little taken back when he then stated he would agree
to having the proposal for Boat Hoist use ONLY and
agreeing to removing ALL OTHER USES from the
application for the zoning change. This would solve the
problem all around and the new owner of the boat hoist
would be a resident of the street, not as it is now with
ownership from outside Bayview Road.

also told EET had been in touch with CRCA re the
moving of the boat hoist out further into the water. I have a
memorandum from the City dated March 14", 2006 re:
subject property that states bottom of page 2: Work in/Near
the St.Lawrence River: Approvals for work within or
adjacent to the limits of the St.Lawrence river require
appropriate approvals from governing agencies. The Start
point for such approvals is the Cataraqui Region
Consevation Authority (CRCA) . The CRCA may be
contacted at 613-546-4228

‘This memorandum was from my real estate files when the
property was put on the market in 2006.

1 told MEE that 1 contacted the CRCA and they checked
their records back to 2006 when he bought the property.

He took legal possession on April 6", 2006.

Page 51 of 126

4.

They have NO RECORD of application or approval for any
work or movement of the boat hoist from its then position.

HR (01d me they had contacted EEE Kehoe
Marine Construction/Lansdowne for moving the hoist
further out into the river and said to me I was welcome to
contact Kehoe which I said I would,

I phoned and emailed Kehoe on May 30", 2016 at 1:29 PM
(Emailed) but as of today 4 PM I have received no reply. I
attach copy of my email,

The movement of this boat hoist out into the river appears to
have further restricted my mothers access to the river (See
survey). This could be determined probably through a
survey which my mother feels she shouldn’t have to pay for
and the onus should be on the people who moved it to prove
it is not infringing on her river access.

Besides moving the boat hoist the present owners decided to
change its use from a boat hoist to a platform/deck which
appears longer and wider than the original structure. All
electrical connection to the shore and electrical panel have
been removed changing its initial use drastically.

[am waiting for a response to my request re: movement of
hoist and also copies of approvals for change of use.

Page 52 of 126

5.
I feel the bottom line on this proposal is: Approve the use of
the property for a Boat Hoist ONLY

‘The question remains was it moved legally with all necessary
applications and approvals. If it wasn’t perhaps it should be
removed entirely.

The residents of Bayview Road are meeting next on
Saturday June 4",

This evening I spoke ton Toronto, Owner of I
Bayview Road, who told me he will be bringing with him
historical information on this property. He will attend the
Saturday meeting.

Ihave many pictures, aerial views surveys which I would be

glad to share with the committee prior to or at the June 7"

meeting. I can be reached a {EE (Cell) email

One Property, Bayview Rd, is a vacant lot

The second property is the subject of the re-

Hi Bayview is selling there has been a constant
stream of tire kickers and generally nosey people
coming and going.

The thought of a zoning change to this subject
property allowing a boathouse and roof deck ;
translation Party Palace would add to already
strained parking, noise, riverview blockages etc.

[Bayview would support an application for use
limited to a boat hoist but no other use. Its been
that way for 40 plus years and that use would be
acceptable.

I wonder since that has been the use over all these
years IS IT NECESSARY FOR A ZONING
CHANGE AT ALL! What about a grandfather

From ove offfpayviow Roney

| would tke to ask to speak at the public meeting Tuesday June 7, 2016 at 6:00 pm.

‘The following is information that | have been told, encountered or researched and at the
time of this writing boliove to be true and would like you to know as background
information before the meeting.

+The above lot used to be pat of tho proporty off Bayviow Road. A past owner
severed tho parts above 80 that he could buld a boat hoist with a ramp
(gangplank) leading out to it and have access tothe river. He then sold the
‘orginal parce! of land with the house, but retained the section referenced above.
Bayview Road had doodod accoss to the river.

+ THs omer ecognizad taBaviow nah rt aaces the rar. ease
500 attached letter). The holst biockad one from doing so but the right way
‘vas nover en issue as the owners and residents off] Bayview woro always
allowed to go on, over and tia up boats tothe gangplank and boat host.

+ Tho prosont overs ofthe above referenced property know of the right of way
before they bought i. The frst timo I came to my property after they had bought
it was met with a work trailer parked over my deeded access and an owner
sitting on a lawn chair reading on the access.

+ went toa lawyer and an oficial request by him was given to remove the
blockages. 1 was told not to touch the hist so I had no access tothe river so my
lawyer went ahead to try to rosolve the issue to one that was fair to me by issuing
a statoment of aim. Ono of the proposals made by them was fo extend the ;
hoist out by about 15 foct to the south. Emails were exchanged but no
agreement was ever signed. | was assured that before anything could be done
ail the proper permits would have to bo done, authorties notified (MN) ard all
residents affocted would have to bo consulted with.

+ was absolutly shocked fo gota phone call one morning thatthe hoist (now |
believe a deck) was being moved out tothe river and tho gangplank extended.
‘Myself, the owner offiBayview and[lJ Bayview had no idea that this was to
happen. | contacted the MINR, the CRCA, and the City of Brockville and al said it
was not their concern. I guess I now had some sort right of access tothe river,
but never agreed to by mo.

Question:
How can ths ty parcel of and sovered off to have parking and accoss to a boat hoist
be zoned residential?

Page 61 of 126

‘As of now | object to the proposed by law change for the following reasons:

1) My view of the river would be blocked by a covered structure such as a boat
house. As of right now | can see the river from my property.

2) On such a small pioce of land and with myself having a six foot right of way, a
structure such as a dock or boathouse and a boat tied to the side, I do not see
how my right of way to the river could be respected

3) The present owners through their past actions have shown that my rights are not
considered. | have included pictures of my access to the river around the hoist
and the way they presently maintain my deeded access to the water.

Public Meeting Tuesday June 7, 2016

Re: Part of Lot 4, Plan 80, being Parts 1,2 and 3, Reference Plan 28R-
6942

My name is IINNNNNN | was born in Brockville and my first home was Il

GER Wy father, then |, have owned 6 Baview Road since
1964.

| am against the proposed zoning change.

There are errors in the proposal as issued in the Brockville recorder
and times. The resident of 5 Bayview Road has never used the
proposed served lots for parking. Also the structure has never been
a dock, it was a boat hoist with a gang plank leading out to it

There are no plans. How can this be approved without plans so that,
all interested parties can see what actually will occur on this site?
Under the document City of Brockville, Comprehensive zoning by
law 7.0 nonresidential and non-commercial zoning table 7.1
indicates Open zoning permits a campground, , rowing club, cottage.
Also on table 7.2 (b) the land in question does not meet the lot and
building requirements of open space. The location and size of the lot
makes this special exception totally inappropriate to be zoned open
space.

From section 3.2.4.3 of the City of Brockville Official plan 4. it states
The City shall consider applications for infill development
intensification and redevelopment of sites and buildings based on

the following criteria: vili. the proposal provides adequate privacy,

to the gangplank. When the applicants bought the property they
knew of the existing right of way over the land and the way the hoist

Section 3.2.8 Crown lands from the Official plan of the City of
Brockville states Construction and alteration of buildings and other
developments on or above Crown land requires a work permit issued
by the MNR. There is no permit and one was never issued.
‘There has been talk that the only thing that would be altered would
be returning the platform to its original function, a boat hoist. If this
is this case why would an open space zoning be necessary as this is
the responsibility of the CRCA

+ With no plans of what, and how something will be built, and the City
saying they are not responsible beyond the waters edge, | am not
confident my views or right of way would be respected under the
proposed zoning change. The only consideration is what goes over
the water, and the this is the role of the CRCA. Therefore a zoning
change in this case would be totally inappropriate.

{nearly February 2007 a letter dated January 30, 2007 was received, rom Laushway Law Office, with a
aim that thee client, NNN had etained them in relation to concerns regarding his right of way to
access the St. Lawrence River

is claim was that lawn chairs and a large trailer were blocking his access, i further stated thatthe fong
existing boat holst obstructed his access and enjoyment. He requested thatthe chars and taller were
removed immediately. These were immediately removed by the awners. He futher questioned the
placement ofthe boat hoist which he claimed obstructed his right of way and demanded removal of the
hoist or we would be subjectto litigation.

‘Asnew owners, we were shocked that a boat holt in existence for over SO years, should suddenly be

RIGHT OF WAY
The right to pass over another's land, more or less
frequently, according to the nature of the easement

RIPARIAN RIGHTS
The rights of the owners of lands on the banks of
watercourses, to take advantageous use of the water on,
under, or adjacent to his land, including the right to acquire
accretions, wharf slips, and fish therefrom.

Page 96 of 126

Riparian Water Rights (or simply riparian rights) isa system of allocating
water among those who possess land about its source. It has its origins in
English common law. It is used in the United Kingdom and states in the
eastern United States and underlies Canadian law regarding water. Under the
riparian principle, all landowners whose property is adjacent to a body of
water have the right to make reasonable use of it If there is not enough water
to satisfy all users, allotments are generally fixed in proportion to frontage on
the water source. These rights cannot be sold ot transferred other than with
the adjoining land, and water cannot be transferred out of the watershed, All
those with riparian rights have the right to reasonable use ~ but not to
removing the water used by others or contaminating it. Among the rights
which are protected are access to water, the right to uncontaminated water,
and the right to enjoyment of property (which is now enshrined in the
Canadian Bill of Rights.)

Essentially, no-one has the right to take away what you have. (Such as
removing a stream, draining a lake, altering water levels, polluting a
lake or stream), Riparian rights includé such things as the tight to access
for’ swimming, boating and fishing; the right to wharf out to a point of
navigability; the right to erect structures such as docks, piers, and boat
lifts; the right to use the water for domestic purposes; the right to
accretions caused by water level fluctuations. Riparian rights also
depend upon "reasonable use” as it relates to other riparian owners to
censure that the rights of one riparian owner are weighed fairly and
equitably with the rights of adjacent riparian owners.

Councilor Deery, Chair, introduced the public meeting and read from the
prepared required comments.

Ms. Pascoe Merkley announced that notice of the Public Meeting was
advertised in the Brockville Recorder and Times Newspaper on May 12, 2016
and was circulated to property owners within 120.0 metres (400.0 feet) of
the subject property. In addition, a sign was posted on the subject property
advising that the lands are the subject of an Application for Amendment to
the City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014,

Councillor Dery, asked that any person wanting further notice of the
passage of the proposed amendment should give their full name, address
and postal code to the Secretary prior to leaving the meeting.

Councillor Deery reviewed the procedures for the Public Meeting.

Ms. Pascoe Merkley provided an overview of the proposed zoning
amendment.

Councillor Dery asked if there was anyone present who wished to speak in
favour of the amendment.

Ms. Vivian Levermore, owner, offered a brief history of the property, stating
that they had purchased the property in May 2006. She explained that at
that time there was a boat hoist and catwalk in place she believes from
sometime in the late 1950's or early 1960's,

Ms. Levermore respectfully requested the approval of the amendment and
assured everyone present that it will not be a major difference in the use of
the roadway or subject land.

Councillor Deery asked if there was anyone else present who wished to
speak in favour of the amendment, seeing none, Councillor Deery asked if
there was anyone present who wished to speak in opposition of the
amendment.

Mr. Clinton Culic introduced himself and stated that he is legal counsel for
the owner of 5 Bayview, Mrs. Kahn. Mr. Culic identified that the City can only
control what happens on land and the Cataraqui Regional Conservation
Authority (CRCA) is responsible for the happenings on the bed of the St.
Lawrence River. He stressed that, in his opinion, this governing body (EDP
Committee) cannot control what is done to the boat hoist as it is not on

shore. Mr. Culic felt the zoning should be changed to “open space zoning”
and does not require a special exception zone to permit the “private marine
facility”.

Mr. Kalle Pugi, 6 Bayview Road, stated that he is against the zoning change.
He explained that he has a 6 foot right of way across the subject lands to
the river. Mr. Pugi is unhappy with the fact there are no plans illustrating the
future intended use of the property. He feels it inappropriate to designate it
‘open space. Mr. Pugi emphasized that if a boat is attached to the dock it will
block his access to the river. In addition, he feels that his view to the river
would not be respected. Mr. Pugi summarized his prior dealings with the
current owners of the lot in question and the reasons for his position.

Mr. Ken Forrest spoke on behalf of his mother Ruth Forrest who lives at 4
Bayview Road. Mr. Forrest stated that he is a real estate broker and is
currently trying to sell his mother's home. Mr. Forrest indicated that the
confusion over this property, the potential severance and zoning change is
holding up the sale of his mother’s home. Mr. Forrest identified himself as
being the representative of all the residents on Bayview Road. Mr. Forrest
summarized his investigation into the history of the land in questioned,
history of the walkway and the boat lift, permits and the like. Mr. Forrest
summarized his reasons for his concerns and position.

Mr. Forrest stated that it is the wish of the Bayview Road property owners to
have the subject lands owned by someone who lives on the street. Mayor
Henderson replied that it would not be within the City’s control to make this,
a stipulation.

Mayor Henderson asked Ms. Pascoe Merkley what the current property
‘owner is permitted to do on these lands. Ms. Pascoe Merkley replied that in
its current state it is too small to bulld on as it does not meet current zone
provisions. The Applicants have no use to attach to this property. Although
the zoning by-law states that if it abuts water a private marine facility may
be permitted.

Councillor Dery asked if there was anyone else who wished to speak on this,
matter. As no one came forward he indicated that this matter will be
considered by the Economic Development and Planning Committee at a
future meeting, which will then make a recommendation to Council.

The meeting adjourned at 7:15 pm. |

The Request for Information Sheets are on file in the Clerk’s Office. |

[APPENDIX U: GUIDELINES FOR IN-WATER AND SHORELINE WORKS
Introduction

‘The Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) administers Ontario Regulation 148/06:
Development, interference with Wetlands and Alterations ta Shorelines and Watercourses pursuant to
Section 28 ofthe Conservation Authorities Act. This Regulation applies to al shorelines, watercourses,
‘waterbodies and wetlands within the CRCA jurisdiction. Works or undertakings within the regulated
‘areas require approval fom the CRCA prior to the works being undertaken in accordance withthe
{Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06 June 2012). in.water works ae often required
to support marine uses, shoreline protection, and wate taking actives.

‘These guidelines apply to in-water and shoreline works, and related activities. They will be used by
CERCA stain the review of permit applications to ensue that these activites meet the intent of the
CRCA's Guidelines for implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06,

1.0 General Guidelines

‘The following general guidelines wil be considered in reviewing permit applications under Ontario
Regulation 148/06 for alin-water and shoreline works, and related activities.

‘Compliance with other applicable legsation will be encouraged through the promotion of the

‘best management practices assocated with that legislation.

) Development within wetlands wil generaly be discouraged. Wetlands generally contain the
bighest divers of organisms. The maintenance of wetland environments through the
‘minimiing and mitigation of development impacts is encouraged. Dredging will not generally
be supported within wetland environments. Proponent willbe encouraged to incorporate best
‘onstruction practices to miaimize impact forthe construction or installation of new docks,
boathouses, boat ports, boat launch ramps, and other similar types of marine facites in
wetland environments.

)_Inorder to maintain heathy shorelines and waterbodies, no more than 25% or 15 metres
whichever less, of any one property owners shoreline shouldbe developed with inwater oF
shoreline structures, exclusive of shoreline erosion protection/retention works.

4) Proponents willbe encouraged to abide by the timing guidelines for fish spawning and/or
species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or Species at Risk
‘Act (see Appendix}.

{Sediment and erosion control measures must be implemented as necessary to prevent the entry
‘of sedimentsinto the water and to contro turbidity levels

1) Projects wil be encouraged tobe of scale and scope consistent withthe limitations of the
‘physical environments that they are located in

2) Shoreline and in-water works will be encouraged to be located » minimum of 45 metres fom
the side lot lnes ofa property as projected into the water perpendicular from the shoreline,

1) Regular maintenance and repair that does not ater the size and/or dimensions ofan existing
structure wil nat requice 8 CRCA permit, Allother repairs, renovations or replacement wil
require a permit, and where possible shal be designed to have a net postive impact on the
environment.

1) Environmentally benign bulding materiale. cedar hme) wil be encouraged forimwater

structures. Treated lumber that meets provincial and federal standards are acceptable for use.


Page 101 of 126

However, pretreated lumber should be dry before itis placed inthe water. Substances not
accepted for marine application (eg creosote treated lumber) wll ot be approved.

1) Alactvties including maintenance procedures are tobe conducted ina manner to contrel the
entry of petroleum products, debris, rubble, concrete or other deleterious substances into the
water

2.0 Docks and Boatits

Docks and boatits by thelr nature are generally located within hazard lands. The Authority wil strive to
‘minimize development within hazard lands to that required to provide forthe storage or berthing of

marine vesees

‘Best management practice considerations for dock and boatift structures willbe to locate structures
where environmental impacts are minimized This wll be accomplished by promoting dock and boatlift
facities that are located and designed ina way that wil:

‘+ have the least impact on fish habitat,
‘maintain natural shorelines, nd
4 minimize shading to preserve aquatc pants

2.4 Guidelines

2) Soli in-water structures wll generally nat be supported,

)Cantilevered loating, and docks supported on legs, posts, or pipes are generally recommended

Generally, docks wil be considered provided they are located at least 4.5 metres from adjacent
property lines (projected perpendicular tothe shoreline). Reductions to this allowance may be
considered on narrow lots where the 45 metre setback cannot be achieved.

4) ib timber or ste!) style docks with open spans may be permitted where warranted by se
specific circumstances, such as areas of heavy wave action and in consideration of large vessels.
Cbs should occupy less than 15 square metres of the lake or river bottom (combined footprint)
Rocks used for the filing of ribs shoul be clean and free of sl taken or imported from land,
and not taken from a lake or river bottom.

12) Generally, docks should have deck surface widths of no greater than 2.44 metres, Deck widths
‘up to-a maximum of 3.66 metres wl be considered only where construction constraints
warrant.

4) Imshallow waters, the extension of dock lengths will be promoted to avoid requests for
redging.

8) Boatlits located adjacent toa dock can be located within the &.5 metre allowance from 2
property ine provided tis located enticely in front of the upland landowners property.

1} Boats should be located at least 2 metres from the shoreline to maintain nearshore currents.

3.0 Bosthouses and Bost Ports

ines through minimal disturbance,

2:1 Guidelines

3) Solidin-water structures will generally not be supported

1). Generally, cantilevered, floating and boathouses/boat ports supported on legs, posts or pipes
are recommended

)- Generally, boathouses and boat ports willbe considered provided they are located at east 4.5,
‘metres from adjacent propery lines (projected perpendicular tothe shoreline). Reductions to
this allowance may be considered on narrow lots where the 45 metre setback cannot be
achieved.

4) Boathouses and boat ports wil be single storey structures with no provisions for human
habitation, New structures that propose aeas for human habitation or that could be converted
for human habitation wil ot be supported

€)_ Upland storage buildings for boats must meet the guidelines fr implementing Ontario
Regulation 148/06 for development.

4) Boathouse Roofs will generally be restricted to 45 metres in height tothe peak (measured from
the fst Noor). Flat roofed boathouses are permitted.

{Crib (ber or steel) style structures with open spans may be permitted where warranted by
site-seciicircumstances such as areas of heavy wave action and to accommodate large
vessels

1h) A boathouse must have an open boat slip within the interior.

|) Services, othe than electrity, are not encouraged.

J) Generally, docks should have deck surface widths of no greater than 2.44 metres. Deck widths
‘up toa maximum of 3.66 metres willbe considered only where construction constraints
warrant.

1) Ci (timber or ste! style supports with open spans may be permitted where warranted by
site-specific ccumstances, suchas areas of heavy wave action and in consideration of large

footprint). Rocks used for the filing of ribs should be clean and fre of sll taken or imported
{rom land, and not taken fom a lake o ver bottom.

1). Boathouses and boat ports shouldbe located at least 2 metres from the shoreline to maint
‘ear shore currents.

'm) Boathouses and boat ports wil be encouraged tobe placed in deeper water depths to avoid
tequests fr edging.

1). The stabilization of existing two storey structures willbe permitted where:

40 Dredging Gnuding the removal or relocation of og, tums, rock)

Dreding is the activity of removing substrate material, usually forthe purposes of improving navigation.
Dredging activities are considered to provde short term solutions to water depth issues since natural
currents and wave action wil result in most dredged areas filing in overtime. Therefore, dredging
generally discouraged and alternatives such as extending dock length, oF relocating facts wil be
explored and encouraged. Landowners willbe advised that where shallow water conditions ae present,
development may be limited or restricted

4.1 Guidelines

2) Logs, stumps, and rocks may be relocated in front of the upland property provided they are not
used to create a breakwater or other structure.

1) Generally, dredging wil not be supported in wetland environments, and in recognized fish
spawning areas.

©) Where dredging may be permitted, the size and depth ofthe area proposed for dredging should
‘be minimized. No more than 25% ofthe shoreline length toa maximum of 15 metres should be
<redged in font of property.

4) single boat channel dredged through a shallow area to deeper water should be no wider than
6 metres; dredging of communal boat channels shared among adjacent property owners should
not exceed 8 metres in width,

Dredged material must be placed in an upland area in accordance withthe CRCA's Guidelines for
Implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06.

1) Dredged material that i being transported over open water must be appropriately contained.

5.0 Shoreline Stabilization
‘Shoreline stabilization involves a variety of works designed to prevent or reduce erosion. These works
include bio-engineering rip-ap, and vertical shore walls usualy composed of armour stone, masonry
rock, conerete, steel, wood, plastic or gablon baskets.

‘hile vertical shore walls have short term benefits, the retention of exiting emergent aquatic
vegetation and planting of addtional trees and shrubs onthe shoreline bank (bio-engineerng) Is the
preferred and most effective method af arresting and preventing further erosion in an environmentally
responsible manner. Riprap, which ithe placement of clean angular stone or rock rubble on slope,
‘may be usd in combination with bioengineering methods where bo-engineering methods alane would
be ineffective. Properly size rp-op placed along the waterfront over a geotextilefiter fabrics
effective in dlisipating wave ation, and preventing sll particles from washing out while allowing land
based moisture to naturally percolate back nto the water body.

5.1 Guidelines

2) Softening ofthe shoreline wil be encourage (vertical to sloped, unegetated to vegetated).
b}_ Excavation (inorder to create gently sloped shoreline) will be encouraged to reduce
encroachment into a waterbody and to minimize the placement of il within the floodplain

Page 104 of 126

‘The preferred methods fr shoreline stabilzation, inorder, are the retention of native shoreline
vegetation, bioengineering and rip-rap-

©) Preservation or enhancement of natural vegetated buffers wil be encouraged.

<8) ip-rapis normally approved provided that

|L__ The work wil follow the existing profiles and contours of the shoreline.

1. The materials clean angular stone o rock that taken or imported from land, nt from
lake or river bottom.

i, A geotextile fer fabric willbe Installed under and behind the rock.

IV, £3: (HV) slope ratio is provided. A slope may nt be steeper than 3:1 unless

supported by an engineered design.

‘Excavation ofthe upland slope to create the appropriate slope angle shall occur. Filing,
excavation or dredging ofthe bed is generally not supported.

‘VL. Encroachment of rip-ap upto 1 metre onto the lake or riverbed may be permitted if the
encroachments required to protect significant trees threatened by erosion, and the
works would not result inthe removal of significant natural shoreline vegetation.

‘iL Encroachment beyond 1 metre may be supported in exceptional ceumstances. These
ill be reviewed ona case by case bass and the quantity of fil placed within the flood
plain must meet the CRCX's Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06,
}- New vertical shore walls may be considered if:

1. Other methods of shoreline stabilization suchas bio-engineering or rip rap have been
considered and found to be unacceptable due to ste conditions (e.g. excessive wave or
ce forces}.

1. The shorewall wil be excavated upland of the high water mark and encroachment on
the bed of or into the waterbody will not occur to minimize placement of iin the flood
plain.

Ii, ter cloth wil be insaled behind the shore wall to prevent the migration of fine into
the water.

|v, Allbackfi willbe clean imported materia.

6.0 Beach Creation

Historically, sand beaches have been created because natural sand beaches and swimming areas are
uncommon within the CRCA' jurisdiction. However, the placement of sand can degrade aquatic
environments (e.g fish spawning areas) a the materil continually washes away and migrates onto the
natural bed of a waterbody. Addktionally, beach creation may also exacerbate erosion problems by
removing natural vegetation along the shoreline.

6.41. Guidelines

4) Generally, beach creation will not be supported.

1b) Replenishment of beach sand below te high water mark will not be supported.

{Upland beaches wil be considered provided they are installed in accordance with the guidelines
{for implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06

4) Generally the placement of aggregate over areas of larger material such as natural rock rubble,
Cor within wetland areas wil not be supported

‘Generally, material placed below te high water mark shall consist of pea gravel.

Page 105 of 126

70 Inland Bost tips

Inland boat stp, or wet slips are small artificial sips or basins excavated into the shoreline bank that are
Intended to provide a protected mooring area for boas.

7A Guidelines

48). Generally, new inland boat slips wil be discouraged.

')- Shoreline stabilization fr the Interior was of existing boat sips shall normally be assessed in
accordance withthe shoreline stabilzation policies in section S above.

©) Any required maintenance dredging shouldbe done to the natural substrate level ofthe
adjacent waterbody.

1) Improvement af the substrate ofthe excavated area to match surrounding natural substrate
conditions wil be encouraged.

8.0 Boat Launch Ramps, and Marine Raivays

‘Boat launch ramps are usualy located at marinas or public parks but are also occasionally proposed fora
residential waterfront property. The creation of a ramp usualy includes excavating o cutting into the
shoreline nd placing gravel rock or concrete to accommodate the launching of @ boat. Use of
‘communal public launches is encouraged to avold the cumulative impacts of altering the shoreline.

"Marine railways consist of a set of tracks and cariage leading into the water that wl alow 2 boat to be
lied entirely ut ofthe water and transported upland when not In us.

18.1 Guidelines

2} Launch ramps should not be constructed in areas that contain wetland communities,

b)- Concrete and wood may be used above the high water mark. The in-water portion shouldbe an
aggregate mixture or a steel gri/grate.

€) Shoreline inswater modifications to accommodate launch ramps shouldbe minimized.

4) Ramps should take advantage of natural slope (upland and n-water conditions and substrates

€¢) Marine railways ae tobe constructed and placed ina manner that will minimize the removal of
shoreline vegetation and wil not require substantial alteration to the shoreline.

9.0 Heat Pump Loops/waterlines/shorewells

‘The placement ofa heat pump loop or a waterline generally does not require CRCA approval. However,
Ifthe placement ofthese items requires excavation o alteration tothe shoreline to factae the
installation, @ CRCA permit is requited. The CRCA’s Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation
148/06 wil be applied in these circumstances.

9.1 Guidelines

42) Removal of shoreline vegetation shouldbe minimized.

'b) Material removed during the installation shouldbe stockpiled and replace over the watering
torestore the shoreline to its previous state

)_ Shorewelcassons shouldbe installed ator above the high water mark.

Page 106 of 126

10.0 Mooring Buovs, Swimming Rafts, Waterski Course and Ramos

Generally, CRCA approvals not required for mooring buoys, swimming rafts, wateski courses and
ramps. However, depending on the scope and scale ofthe works, a permit maybe required. Permit
‘requirements willbe considered in accordance withthe CRCA's Guidelines for Implementing Ontario
Regulation 148/06.

[APPENDIX U: GUIDELINES FOR IN-WATER AND SHORELINE WORKS

Introduction

‘The Cataragui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) administers Ontario Regulation 148/06:
Development, Interference with Wetlands and Alterations to Shorelines and Watercourses pursuant ta
Section 28 ofthe Conservation Authorities Act. Ths Regulation applies to all shorelines, watercourses,
aterbodies and wetlands within the CRCA jurisdiction. Works or undertakings within the regulated
‘areas require approval from the CRCA prior to the works being undertaken, in accordance withthe
{Guidelines for implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06 June 2012. In-water works are often required
‘0 support marine uses, shoreline protection, and water taking activities.

‘These guidelines apply ton water and shoreline works, and related activities. They wil be used by
CECA stan the review of permit applications to ensure that these acthities meet the intent ofthe
‘CRCA’s Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06,

1.0 General Guidelines

‘The following general guidelines will be considered in reviewing permit applications under Ontario
Regulation 148/06 for allin water and shoreline works and related activities

28} Compliance with other applicable legistation will be encouraged theough the promotion ofthe
best management practices associated with that legislation.

1b) Development within wetlands wll generally be discouraged. Wetlands generally contain the
highest diversity of organisms. The maintenance of wetland environments through the
‘minimiiog and mitigation of development impacts fs encouraged. Dredging wil not generally
be supported within wetland environments. Proponents willbe encouraged to incorporate best
construction practices to minimize impact forthe construction or installation of new dock,
boathouses, boat ports, boat launch ramps, and other similar types of marine facilities in
wetland envionments

‘d_tmorder to maintain healthy shorelines and waterbodies, no more than 25% oF 15 metres
whichever is less, of any one property owner's shoreline should be developed with inwater or
shoreline structures, exclusive of shoreline erosion protetion/rtention works.

4) Proponents wll be encouraged to abide by the timing guidelines for ish sparing and/or
species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or Species at Rsk
‘Act (see Append),

}, Sediment and erosion control measures must be implemented as necessatyto prevent the entry
of sediments into the water and to contal turbidity levels

A Projets willbe encouraged to be of scale and scope consistent with the imitations ofthe
physical environments that they ae located i,

1) Shoreline and in-water works willbe encouraged to be located a minimum of 45 metres from

the side lt lnes ofa property as projected Into the water perpendicular from the shoreline.

Regular maintenance and repair that does not alter the size and/or dimensions of an existing

structure wil nt require a CRCA permit. Allother repairs, renovations of replacement will

requie a permit, and where possible sal be designed to have a net positive impact on the
environment.

1) Environmentally benign building material (eg. cedar lumber wil be encouraged for inwater
structures, Treated lumber that meets provincial and federal standards are acceptable for use.

Page 108 of 126

However, pretreated lumber should be dry before itis placed in the water. Substances not
accepted fr marine application (eg creosote treated lumber wll not be approved.

3) Allactvtes including maintenance procedures are tobe conducted in a manner to control the
entry of petroleum products, debris, rubble, concrete or other deleterious substances into the
water,

Docks and Bootie

Docks and boats by thelr nature are generally located within hazard lands. The Authority wil strive to
‘minimize development within hazard lands to that required to provide forthe storage or brthing of
marine vessels.

Best management practice considerations fr dack and boat structures wl be to locate structures
where environmental impacts are minimized. This willbe accomplished by promoting dock and boat

faci

ost

ites that are located and designed ina way that wi:

‘+ have the least impact on fish habitat,
‘maintain natural shorelines, and
4+ minimize shading to preserve aquatic plants

2.4 Guidelines

2} Sold in-water structures will generally not be supported,

1) Cantilevered oating, and docks supported on legs, posts, or pipes ae generally recommended.

Generally, dock wil be considered provided they are located at least 4.5 metres from adjacent
property ines (rojeted perpendicular tothe shoreline), Reductions to this allowance may be
considered on narrow lots where the 4.5 metre setback cannot be achieved.

4} Crib (timber or steel) style docks with open spans may be permitted where warranted by ste-
speci circumstances, such a areas of heavy wave ation and in consideration of large vessels
Cribs should occupy les than 15 square metres ofthe ake or river bottom (combined foatpint)
Rocks use forthe filing of cribs should be lean and fee of sll, taken oF imported fom land,
and not taken from a lake or river bottom.

€}- Generally, docks should have deck surface widths of no greater than 2.44 metres, Deck widths
up toa maximum of 3.66 metres wil be considered only where construction constraints

4) Inshallow waters, the extension of dock lengths wil be promoted to avold requests for
‘redging.

{8} Boats located adjacent to a dock an be located within the 45 metre allowance from a
property ine provided itis located entirely in front of the upland landowners property.

1} Boatits should be located at least 2 metres from the shoreline to maintain nearshore currents.

‘Boathouses and Boat Ports

thouses and boat ports are structures designe to shelter boats from the sun and

inand often

provide boat storage during the winter. Aboathouse has a roof, walls anda front door while a boat port

sists ofa rot (supported on posts) and no walls

Page 109 of 126

‘Best management practice considerations for boathouse and bost port structures willbe to locate
structures where environmental impacts are minimized. Ths willbe accomplished by promoting
‘boathouse and boat port facilities that are located and designed in a way tat wil

‘+ have the least impact on fish habitat,
‘result inthe maintenance of natural shorelines through minimal disturbance,
+ mininze shading to preserve aquatic plants, and

+ have appropriate water depths to avoid requests for dredging

3.1 Guidelines

8) Soli in-water structures wil generally not be supported

1) Generally cantilevered, fosting, and boathouses/boat ports supported on legs, posts or pipes
are recommended.

)_ Generally, boathouses and boat ports willbe considered provided they are located atleast 4S
retres from adjacent property lines (projected perpendicular tothe shoreline). Reductions to
thisalowance may be considered on narrow lots where the 4.5 metre setback cannot be
achieved

4) Boathouses and boat ports wil be singe storey structures with no provisions for human
habitation. New structures that propose area for human habitation or that could be converted
for human habitation wil not be supported.

€}- Upland storage buildings fr boats must meet the guidelines for implementing Ontario
Regulation 148/06 fr development.

Boathouse Roos will generally be restricted to 4.5 metres in height tothe peak (measured trom
the fis floor). Flat roofed boathouses are permite

£8) Crib (timber or ste) style structures with open spans may be permitted where warranted by
sitespeciicircumstances such as areas of heavy wave action and to accommodate large
vessels

1) Abboathouse must have an open boat sip within the interior.

1) Services, other than electricity, are nt encouraged.

1) Generally, docks should have deck surface widths of no greater than 2.44 metres. Deck widths
Lup toa maximum of 3.66 metres wil be considered only where construction constraints

1) ib (timber o tet) style supports with open spans may be permitted where warranted by
site-specie circumstances, such a areas of heavy wave action and in consideration of large
vessels. Cribs should occupy less than 15 square metres of the lake or river bottom (combined
footprint. Rocks used for the ling of cribs should be clean and free of sil, taken or imported
fom land, and not taken from a lake or rver bottom.

1) Boathouses and boat ports shouldbe located at least 2 metres from the shoreline to maintain
near shore curents.

'm) Boathouses and boat ports willbe encouraged to be placed in deeper water depths to avoid
requests for dedeing.

1) The stabilization of existing two store structures wil be permitted where:

|. The existing support structures willbe replaced/repaird with identical
construction methodology.

|i. The support structures are being replaced witha new construction methodology
‘and itis demonstrated through proper engineering analysis by a qualified

professional engineer thatthe new support structures are a eas as trong
(able to withstand the forces acting upon it) asthe previous support structures

40° prec stumps, rock)

edging isthe activity of removing substrate material usualy forthe purposes of improving navigation
Dredging activities are considered to provide short term solutions to water depth issues since natural
currents and wave action wil result in most dredged areas filing in over time. Therefore, dredging
‘generally discouraged and alternatives such a extending dock length, or relocating facilities willbe
‘explored and encouraged. Landowners willbe advised that where shallow water conditions are present,
evelopment may be limited or restricted.

4.1 Guidelines

2) Logs, stumps and rocks may be relocated infront ofthe upland property provided they ae not

tsed to create a breakwater or other structure,

Generally, dredging wil not be supported ia wetland environments, and in recognized fish

paving areas.

©) Where dredging may be permitted, the size and depth ofthe area propose for dredging should
bbe minimized. No more than 25% of the shoreline length to 2 maximum of 15 metres should be
Aredged infront of property.

4) single boat channel dredged through a shallow area to deeper water should be na wider than
‘6 metres; dredging of communal boat channels shared among adjacent property owners should
‘ot exceed 8 metres in width

€) Dredged material must be placed in an upland area in accordance with the CRCR's Guidelines for
Implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06.

‘1 redged material thats being transported over open water must be appropriately contained.

D

5.0 Shoreline Stabilization

Shoreline stabilization involves a varity of works designed to prevent or reduce erosion. These works
Include bio-engineerng ip-rap, and vertical shore walls usually composed of armour stone, masonry
rock, concrete, stel, wood, plastic or gabion baskets

‘While vertical shore walls have short term benefits the retention of existing emergent aquatic
vegetation and planting of additional trees and shrubs onthe shoreline bank (bo-engineering) Is the
preferred and most effective method of arresting and preventing further erosion in an environmentally
responsible manner. Rip-rap, which ithe placement of clean angular stone or rock rubble ona slope,
‘may be usd in combination with bioengineering methods where bo-engineering methods alone would
be inetfective. Properly sized rp-ap placed along the waterfront over a geotextile fier fabrics
‘effective in dissipating wave action, and preventing sol particles from washing out while allowing land
‘based moisture to naturally percolate back int the waterbody.

s..cudtnes

{8} Softening ofthe shoreline wil be encouraged (vertical to sloped, unvegetated to vegetated)
1) Excavation (in order to create genty sloped shorelines) wil be encouraged to reduce
‘encroachment into waterbody and to minimize the placement of il within the flood pan,


Page 111 of 126

‘The preferred methods for shoretne stabilization, inorder, are the retention of native shoreline
_vegetation, bio-engineering and rip-ap.

)_ reservation or enhancement of natural vegetated buers willbe encouraged.

4) ‘ip-ap is normally approved provided that:

|. The works wil follow the exiting profiles and contours of the shoreline.

|. The materials clean angular stone or rock that is taken or imported from land, nat fom
a lake or river bottom.

M.A geotextie fier fabric willbe installed under and behind the rock

|W, 43:1 (HY) slope ratios provided. A slope may not be steeper than 31 unless
‘supported by an engineered design.

\¥. Excavation ofthe upland slope to create the appropriate slope angle shall occur. Filing,
‘excavation or dredging ofthe bed is generally not supported,

VL Encroachment of rip-ap upto 1 metre onto the lake or riverbed may be permitted ifthe
‘encroachment i required to protect significant trees threatened by erosion, and the
works wotld not result inthe removal of significant natural shoreline vegetation.

‘Yn. Encroachment beyond 1 metre maybe supported in exceptional cumstances. These
will be reviewed ona case by case basis and the quantity of il placed within te flood
plain must meet the CRCA's Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation 248/06.
}- New vertical shore walls may be considered if:

|. Other methods of shoreline stabilization suchas bio engineering or rp-ap have been
‘considered and found to be unacceptable due to site conditions (eg. excessive wave or
ce forces}.

The shorewall wil be excavate upland ofthe high water mark and encroachment on
the bed of or into the waterbody will not occur to minimize placement of iin the flood
plain,

IML Filter cloth wil be installed behind the shore wal to prevent the migration of fies into
the water

IV. Allbackfil willbe clean imported materi

60 Beach Creation

Historically, sand beaches have been created because natural sand beaches and swimming ares are
uncommon within the CRCA'S Jurisdiction, However, the placement of sand can degrade aquatic
‘environments (eg ish spawning areas) 3s the material continually washes away and migrates onto the
natural bed ofa water body. Additional, beach creation may also exacerbate erosion problems by
‘removing natural vegetation along the shoreline.

6.1 Guidelines

2). Generally, beach creation wil not be supported.

b) Replenishment of beach sand below the high water mark will not be supported,

)_ Upland beaches wil be considered provided they are installed in accordance with the guidelines
{or implementing Ontario Regulation 148/06

4) General, the placement of aggregate over areas of larger material suchas natural rock rubble,
‘or within wetland areas wil nt be supported.

€}- Generally, material placed below the high water mark shal consist of pea gravel


Page 112 of 126

7.0 Inland Boot Sips

{nland boat sips, oF wet slips are smal artifical sips or basin excavated into the shoreline bank that are
Intended to provide a protected mooring area for boas.

17. Guidelines

2}, Generally, new inland boat slips wil be discouraged,

1) Shoreline stabilization forthe interior walls of existing boat sips shall normally be assessed in
accordance with the shoreline stabilization policies in section 5 above

)_Any required maintenance dredging shouldbe done to the natural substrate level ofthe
adjacent waterbody.

4) Improvement of the substrate ofthe excavated area to match surrounding natural substrate
conditions wll be encourage.

8.0 Boat Launch Ramps, and Marine Rallways

‘Boat launch ramps are usualy located at marinas or publc parks but are aso occasionally proposed fora
residential waterfront property. The creation of ramp usualy includes excavating or cutting into the
shoreline and placing grave, rock or concrete to accommodate the launching ofa boat. Use of
‘communal public aunches s encouraged to avoldthe cumulative impacts of altering the shoreline,

‘Marine ralways consist ofa st of tracks and carriage leading nto the water that wil alow a boat to be
lifted entirely out ofthe water and transported upland when notin use.

18.1 Guidelines

42) Launch ramps should not be constructed in areas that contain wetland communities.

) Concrete and wood may be used above the high water mark. The in-water portion should be an
sagregate mixture or a steel ri/erate,

Shoreline in-water mosifications to accommodate launch ramps shouldbe minimized.

14) Ramps should take advantage of natural slope (upland and in-water) conditions and substrates.

€@) Marne aways ae tobe constructed and placed ina manner that will minimize the removal of
‘shoreine vegetation and wil net requir substantial aeration to the shoreline.

‘9.0 Heat Pump Loops/waterlines/shorewlls

The placement ofa heat pump loop or a watertine generally does not require CRCA approval, However,
ifthe placement ofthese tems requires excavation of alteration tthe shoreline to facitate the
Installation, a CRCA permits required. The CRCA’s Guidelines for Implementing Ontario Regulation
148/06 wil be applied in these circumstances.

9.1 Guidelines

42), Removal of shoreline vegetation shouldbe minimized.

1b) Material removed during the installation should be stockpiled and replaced over the watering
to restore the shoreline to its previous state

)Shorewell cassons shouldbe installed at or above the high water mark.

‘Generaly,CRCA approvals not required for mooring buoys, swimming rafts, waters courses and
‘amps. However, depending on the Scope and scale ofthe works, a permit may be required. Permit
requirements willbe considered in accordance with the CRCA’s Guidelines for Implementing Ontario
Regulation 148/06.

REGISTERED PLAN 335, BROCKVILLE J. FAURSCHOU
‘OWNER: MARY ANN CLARKE PLANNER |
APPLICANT: EASTERN ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

FILE: 287-11

RECOMMENDATION:

THAT Lot 23 and Lot 24, Registered Plan 335, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, be
deemed not registered.

ORIGIN:

A letter of request to deem Lot 23 and Lot 24 not to be a part of Plan 335, dated 26 May,
2016, has been submitted by David Poole-Eastem Engineering Group Inc., acting as
‘Agent for Ms. Mary Ann Clarke, Owner of lands described as Lots 23 and 24, Plan 335,
(Pineview Heights Subdivision) City of Brockville, County of Leeds. The letter of request
js attached as Schedule “A” to this report. The location of the subject property is
indicated on Schedule "B” attached to this report.

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS:

(On 26 May 2016, the Planning Department received a request for Lots 23 and 24 of Plan
335, to be deemed not to be registered. The Owner has proposed a single detached
dwelling which, due to the challenging grade of the site, straddles the subject lots. The
concept development plan has been attached as Schedule "C”. Accordingly, the lots are
required to be joined. "The most expedient method to achieve this goal is to have Lot 23
and Lot 24 of Plan 335 deemed as being not registered.

‘The Ontario Planning Act, 1990, c.P. 13, Section 50. (4), addresses the matter of the
designation of a plan or subdivision or part thereof as not being deemed registered as
follows:

"50 (4) The council of a local municipality may by by-law designate any
plan of subdivision, or part thereof, that has been registered for eight years
‘or more, which shall be deemed not to be a registered plan of subdivision
for the purposes of subsection (3). R.S.0. 1990, c. P.13, s. 60 (4).”

‘The underlying registered plan of subdivision for the lands subject to this application was
created in 1977, and was subject to a Subdivision Agreement between 257244 Land
Developments Limited and the Corporation of the City of Brockville authorized by By-law
47-T7 on 15 March 1977. The subdivision was completed, with the exception of Lots 23,
and 24, Plan 335. On 26 June 1984, By-law 116-84 was endorsed by Council wherein
Plan 335 was assumed, various lands dedicated and named and the Owner was released
{rom all obligations pursuant to the Agreement.

Accordingly, the plan of subdivision exceeds the required minimum of eight (8) years to
permit a portion of the subdivision to be considered as not being registered,

Plan 335, which is located primarily on Pineview Road, contains 4 lots fronting on King
Street West. The two easterly lots have been developed with single detached dwellings
and the two remaining westerly lots, being Lots 23 and 24, are vacant. The lots are
generally steep, rocky and therefore challenging to develop.

Lot 23 has an area of 960.71 m?. Lot 24 has an area of 980.82 m?. The combined lot
areas would therefore be 1,941.53 m*. City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014, as
‘amended, requires a minimum lot area of 525 m?.

Lot 23 has a frontage of 28.95 m?, Lot 24 has a frontage of 24.38 m?. The combined lot
frontage would be 53.34 metres. City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014, as
‘amended, requires a minimum lot frontage of 17 m.

the proposed dwelling, garage and covered area is 302.12 m*. The

‘The request to deem Lots 23 and 24, Plan 335 as being not part of a registered plan was.
circulated on 02 June 2016 to various Departments for comment and review with the
following results:

1, The Operations Department confirmed, on 17 June 2016, that they have no
objection to the deeming of Lots 23 and 24,

2. The Environmental Services Department confirmed, on 16 June 2016, that the two
lots are separately serviced to the lot line. Development utilizing only one service
is not an issue as the unused service will remain capped,

“Environmental Services are not opposed to the two lots being combined into one.
The Lot Grading and Drainage for the Plan of Subdivision will have to be altered
accordingly.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville, Policy 6.4.5.1. 14., addresses the matter of
deeming lots not to be registered as follows:

“14. The City may consider passing a By-law under the provisions of the
Planning Act deeming old registered, undeveloped plans which are
‘inadequate due to matters such as lot size, unsuitable access or undesirable
location, not to be registered.”

Given that the lots in question consist of undeveloped lots which are serviced but
dificult to develop individually, the request is considered by the Planning Department
to be reasonable,

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Financial considerations to the City of Brockville would consist of the potential for reduced

taxation should reassessments by MPAC occur as expected upon completion of the
deeming process.
