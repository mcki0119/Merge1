DELEGATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS

1. Inventory of City’s Heritage Resources
(Mr. Paul Bullock, Chair Heritage Brockville)

Mr. Bullock explained that in November of 2013 he had presented to the Committee a
potential list of homes to be registered. At that time, as a result of being contacted by
many property owners the City Clerk recommended contacting each home owner to
‘advise them that their home was in the process of being registered to this inventory.
Mr. Bullock offered that all 74 of the homeowners were sent a letter explaining the
process which resulted in 15 homes being removed from the list. He is therefore
‘seeking Council's approval to add the remaining 59 homes to the inventory of City's
Heritage Resources.
