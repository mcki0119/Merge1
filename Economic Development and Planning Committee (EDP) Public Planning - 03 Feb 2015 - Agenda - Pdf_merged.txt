‘occupancy due to proximity to the courthouse.

2. Brent Caskenette, Chief Building Official
+ No.concem; however, the applicant willbe required to apply for a Change
of Use Permit. Should renovations be necessary to convert the building, a

Building Permit will be required before any renovations take place.

3. Steve Allen, Supervisor of Engineering, Environmental Services Department:

‘+ This property has over 5 spaces and therefore Site Pian Control will apply.
As part of the applicant parking areas in residential and commercial

to be followed, pre/post runoff for a 1:5 year storm and overland analysis
for 1:100 storm,

+ Engineering would like the Zoning By-law to be followed in relation to
Paving of the parking area. This helps with on-site storm water
management as well as pavement marking and general maintenance.

Scheduled to be upgraded in the next couple of years depending upon
Capital funding and approvals.

‘4. Conal Cosgrove, Director of Operations, Operations Department:

‘+ No comments on the proposed use of the property; however, with respect
to the request for the gravel parking area, the entrance from Pine Street

reduce the possibilty of tracking gravel onto the road allowance.

Potential Issues for Discussion:

‘Appropriateness of the requested zoning,

Gravel Parking vs Paved Parking,

Future development issues, if any, conceming the conversion back to
residential,

Appropriateness of retaining the option to revert to a residential use.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The contents ofthis report are provided for information purposes for the Public Meeting.
Following the Public Meeting, Planning Department Staff will prepare a report which will
include review and consideration of policies that are relevant to the requested
