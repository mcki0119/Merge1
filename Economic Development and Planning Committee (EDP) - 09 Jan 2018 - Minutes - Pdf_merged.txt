L. White reviewed the report for the Committee.

Councillor Bursey wondered it a “flex” implementation date had been
considered as many reservations have already been made for 2018. L. White
responded that it hadn’t been considered yet but they are still ironing out
details.

Councillor Kalivas asked if they had done any consultation with the affected
parties. L. White responded that she has dealt only with the Chamber of
Commerce staff. P. Robertson, Executive Director and the Chamber of
Commerce indicated that she has met with hoteliers.

‘There was a discussion on how the tax revenue should be distributed. They
will have this discussion again when this goes to Council on January 23,
2018.
