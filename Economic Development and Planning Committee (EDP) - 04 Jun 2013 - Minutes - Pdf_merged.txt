Tuesday, June 04, 2013

Mr. Andrew McGinnis, Planner Il reviewed the request for the Committee. He explained that
the request was to extend the hours for construction from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm every Monday
to Friday and 8:00 am to 7:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday during the month of June.

Mr. McGinnis cautioned the Committee regarding the hours on a Sunday due to the close
proximity to many houses of worship. He felt at the very least they might want to only allow the
construction after 12:00 noon,

Councilor Kalivas was in agreement and felt that maybe they should just prohibit construction
‘on Sundays all together.

Councillor McFall was in agreement with Councillor Kalivas.
Moved by: Councillor McFall
‘THAT the hours from Monday to Friday be extended to add 7:00 to 10:00 pm, and Saturday

hours be 8:00 to 7:00 pm but construction on Sunday will remain prohibited,
