Committee at a future meeting.

PURPOSE

To provide information for purposes of conducting a Public Meeting under the Planning
‘Act respecting an Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-

BACKGROUND

The subject property was originally developed as 2 showroom and extension of the
former Reliable Fumiture store. A subsequent owner, Kings Plate Development Corp
and Downtown West Brockville Development Inc., applied for and received approval for
changes to permit re-use of the building as a residential condominium. Demolition of
the linkage between the King Street store frontage and the rear building and various
interior demolition work was undertaken inside the rear building. However, no further
work was done towards conversion of the building to a residential condominium and the
project stalled. The subject property came into the ownership of Juno (Brockville)
Limited.

Jane Almond, MCIP, RPP, acting for the property owner, filed an application for
‘amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 with respect to lands legally
described as Plan 67 Blk 30 Lots 40 to 42, 46 and 47 Pt Lots 37 to 39 and 43 RP 28R

Brockville, County of Leeds; municipal address 10 John Street. The application for an
‘amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014 would rezone the subject land from R5-2-
Multiple Residential Special Exception Zone to MD-Mixed Use Downtown Special
