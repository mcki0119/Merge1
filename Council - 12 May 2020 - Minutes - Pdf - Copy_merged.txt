MAYOR'S REMARKS.

Mayor Baker noted that this week is National Police Week. He took the opportunity
to send best wishes to the Brockville Police Service.

His Worship noted Monday was the first day that retailers were able to open with
curbside pickup. He encouraged everyone to shop local and remember the small
businesses that have been closed and for the community to show their support.

The Royal Brockville Retirement Resident has experienced an outbreak of COVID-
19. Under the present guidelines an outbreak is defined as one confirmed patient.

This weekend if the first long weekend of the summer. It has been incredible to
see the compliance to restrictions within the community which has helped deter
the spread. It was noted that there has been a drop in the level of compliance
within the community which is evidenced by the the increase in call volume
received by the police. Residents are asked to adhere to the provincial guidelines
to ensure that the spread of the virus remains low. The risks to the hospital and
vulnerable population are real. COVID-19 is not over and life is not returning to
normal yet. Call upon the community for continued diligence and thank you for all
that has been done to date.
