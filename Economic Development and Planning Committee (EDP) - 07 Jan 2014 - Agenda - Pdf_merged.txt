CITY OF BROCKVILLE PLANNER I
OWNER: 653973 ONTARIO LTD.

APPLICANT: J. MALOVIC

FILE: 08T-10501

RECOMMENDATION:

THAT draft approval for the Draft Plan of Subdivision on lands described as Part of Blocks
A&B, Registered Plan 375, City of Brockville, County of Leeds be extended for a three
(8) year period.

ORIGIN:

At its meeting of 8 February 2011, Council for the Corporation of the City of Brockvilo
granted approval to the Draft Pian of Subdhvision for Part of Blocks A & B, Registered Plan
375, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, subject to conditions. A location plan has been
attached as Schedule “A” to this report.

Condition No. 7 of the draft approval states that, “if final approval of the Plan is not
granted within three (3) years of the date of approval of the Draft Plan, as redlined, and no
extensions have been granted, Draft Plan approval shall lapse in accordance with
Section 51(32) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, ¢.P. 13"

The deadline for granting of final approval would therefore be 4 February 2014,

Mr. J. Malovic, acting on behalf of 653979 Ontario Lid., has requested an extension of
draft approval for an additional three (3) years. An e-mail sent to Mr. Jonathan
Faurschou, Planner |, with the City of Brockville, indicates Mr. J. Malovie's reasons for
requesting an extension. A copy of this e-mail has been attached to this report as
Schedule “B”.

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS:

The Planning Department has been working closely with 653973 Ontario Ltd. with respect
to the outstanding issues regarding a new plan of subdivision for Part of Blocks A & B,
Registered Plan 375, City of Brockville. As noted in Mr. J. Malvoic’s reasons, he sees an

Applicant: Mr. J. Malovie

File: 087-1050

‘on-going need to maintain an inventory of building lots for his company in order to
Continue to buildin Brockville. He does not want all of the design work and drawings that
have been completed (at significant cost and time) to be wasted or to have to be redone in
the future, and states that the building market in Brockville has a slow uptake rate so the
typical three (3) year period to obtain final approval is too shor.

‘As well, other conditions imposed at the request of the City’s Environmental Services
Department, Fire Department and the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority remain
outstanding

‘Any draft approved subdivision is a pre-commitment to municipal servicing capacity
Since this matter involves a re-submission of two (2) existing blocks within Registered
Pian 375 (Bridlewood Subdivision), those lands already have an existing allocation of
sewer capacity. Regardless, the City’s Water Treatment Plant and Water Pollution
Control Centre are both running well short of their respective capacity limits, therefore
municipal servicing capacity in not an issue.

Based on the above, itis the recommendation of the Planning Department that a three (3)
year extension be granted to the Draft Approval that was given on 8" February 2011 to
allow the applicant time to finalize these matters.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.
Official Plan Policy 6.4.5.1 (13) states that, “In approving a draft plan of subdivision or
condominium, the City may require that the approval lapses at the expiration of a
specified time period, being less than 3 years. The City may extend the approval time
Period, prior to its expiration.”

Based on the above Official Plan Policy, staff believes that it reasonable for Council to
allow the proposed extension for a period of three (3) additional years.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

‘There are no financial considerations to the City of Brockville at this time.

CONCLUSION:

‘Should the Economic Development and Planning Committee recommend to Council that
the requested extension of three (3) years be approved; the new expiry date for the Draft
Pian conditions to be completed will be 4 February 2017.

In response to the concems outlined above by a neighbour, the applicant stated at the

George's Fish and Chips’. The restaurant is a small franchise and will not have a liquor

“D" to this report.

ANALYSISIOPTIONS
Provincial Policy Considerations:

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2006 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
Consistent with" the Provincial Policy Statement

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial
Interest. Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under
consideration, and thus, only those relevant portions willbe referenced below.

Section 1.1.3.1 states that “Settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and their
vitality and regeneration shall be promoted”.

Section 1.1.3.2 states that "Land use pattems within settlement areas shall be based
on
@. densities and a mix of land uses which:

2. efficiently use land and resources:

. are appropriate for, and efficiently use, the infrastructure and public
service fecilties which are planned or available, and avoid the need
for their unjustified andior uneconomical expansion; and

. minimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, and
promote energy efficiency in accordance with policy 1.8; and

b. a range of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
‘accordance with the citera in policy 1.1.3.3."

Proposed Amendment to Zoning By-law 194-94, 241 Park Street

‘Owner: 1522868 Ontario Limited

‘Agent: Surinder Gill

File: D14-170

‘Section 1.1.3.3 states that "Planning Authorities shall identify and promote opportunities
for intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated taking. into
‘account existing building stock or areas, including Brownfield sites, and the availabilty
Of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilties required to
‘accommodate projected needs.”

‘Section 1.3.1 states that “Planning authorities shall promote economic development and
‘competitiveness by:

a) providing for an appropriate mix and range of employment (including industrial,
‘commercial and institutional uses) to meet long-term needs;

») providing opportunities for a diversified economic base, including maintaining a
range and choice of suitable sites for employment uses which support a wide
range of economic activities and ancillary uses, and take into account the needs
of existing and future businesses;

©) planning for, protecting and preserving employment areas for current and future
uses; and

4d) ensuring the necessary infrastructure is provided to support current and
projected needs.

‘Section 1.6.5.4 speaks to a land use pattem, density and mix of uses that minimize the
number of vehicle trips and supports the development of viable choices and plans for
public transit and other alternative transportation modes.

‘Accordingly, since the conversion of the existing building to add an additional
‘commercial use will be located within close proximity to public transit, and within an
‘existing built-up area, the proposed use further strengthens the area, represents
intensification, and brings additional employment opportunities to the City of Brockville,
thereby being consistent with the policies within the PPS.

Official Plan Considerations

‘The Official Plan designates the subject property as “Neighbourhood Area” within the
“Mixed Use Corridor’

The New Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and
vitality, that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned.

Section 2.3 outiines strategic planning themes which includes “A Sustainable, Healthy,
and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City”, “A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities", and “A Well-Pianned Responsive City”

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. More specifically,
Sections 3.2.2.1 outlines policies for the scope of development for "Neighbourhood

Proposed Amendment to Zoning By-law 194-94, 241 Park Street

‘Owner: 1522868 Ontario Limited

‘Agent: Surinder Gil

File: 014-170

‘Areas within the Mixed Use Corridor’ as envisioned as a City-wide focal point,
‘accommodating a range of commercial / retail / service uses; and non-industrial uses,
‘and population-related employment uses; a mix of residential uses; municipal and
‘community services and facilities; and entertainment and cultural facilities.

‘There is focus on opportunities for intensification, infiling on existing lots of record and
the rounding-out of existing development pattems, Development within these areas is,
‘encouraged to be low to medium density housing and local commercial uses. However,
the character and identity of existing areas shall be sustained and enhanced.

‘The general Neighbourhood Area policies are further refined under Section 4.3.2
wherein "Neighbourhood Commercial uses such as convenience stores, personal
service establishments, small-scale eating establishments, and other similar
convenience commercial uses that serve the day-to-day needs of the neighbourhood
shall be permitted subject to locational criteria’,

‘The proposed development satisfies all the criteria required within the Official Plan, As
no change to the building footprint is proposed (other than the seasonal patio), there will
be little to no impact on adjacent property owners as ail policies are being adhered to.

Zoning By-law Considerations:
241 Park Street is currently zoned C1-X4-1 Local Commercial Special Exception Zone

(attached as Schedule “B") under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94,
amended.

The property is currently improved with a building occupied by Cowan's Dairy Bar and
‘The Cutting Edge Meat Shop, a small green space area and associated parking.

‘There is a special exception zone already in place on the subject lands, which allows an
‘expanded range of uses as well as development standards specific to this site.

The proposed amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 would, if
approved, add @ "Restaurant-Eat-In" as a permitted use in the C1-X4-1 Zone. This new
use is proposed to proceed through renovations to a portion of the existing building, and
would be accessed by an independent doorway on the north face of the building. In
‘addition, the owner is proposing minor changes to the exterior of the building for a
‘seasonal patio as well as changes to the parking layout on the north side of the building.

‘All work associated with the conversion of the property to accommodate the proposed
Use is subject to review for Building Permit and compliance with applicable legislation,
‘Any changes that are required to the site are subject to the conditions outlined within an
‘existing Site Plan Control Agreement,

‘Owner: 1522868 Ontario Limited

Agent: Surinder Gill

File: 14-170

This proposal is supportable. if endorsed, the existing special exception zone would be
modified simply be adding a new use to those uses permitted in the C1-X4-1 Zone.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS

AAs stated in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed rezoning of 241 Park
Street is consistent with the PPS and the Official Plan for the City of Brockville.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with the redevelopment of the subject property are the
responsibilty of the Owner.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for zoning amendment for 241 Park Street, it is reasonable to
amend the existing C1-X4-1 Special Exception Zone to allow the addition of a
"Restaurant ~ Eat-in” as a permitted use. All other uses currently permitted would be
unchanged, and all current zone provisions would remain in effect

This conclusion is reflected in the recommendation section at the beginning of this

‘The proposed amendment to add a permitted use ofan eat-in restaurant tothe uses currently permitted isnot an
unfavourable addition

However the generality of the description ofan eatin restaurant leaves afew questions The site specific zoning should
bbe specifi to lst how the busines isto operate, to ensure the commercial actity of the eat-in restaurant remains
within the currently residential neighbourhood, friendly uses, sisted in the C1 Zoning. Hours of operation could be
limited to ensure late night operations do not deter from the peaceful nights currently enjoyed in our neighbourhood,
‘Also a liquor licence would not be in keeping withthe current uses at this location

‘Asite plan forms part ofthis site specific zoning and upon review ofthat site plan it appears a mistake has been made by
the engineer designing the pian. AS| was advised the drainage ofthe pave area was to result in deposit into the grass
{area within the property at the north west side. The elevations shawn onthe plan, which are existing would direct all
flow from the paved services to the est sie ofthe property and result in depositing the run of precipitation onto the
‘vacantiot to the east. A solid curb is proposed along the east sde and space parking curbs along the north and west side
‘of the pavement area. The design ofthe parking lot would result in allhe runoff precipitation flowing into Amy Stand
‘un eastery tothe cateh basins infront of 17 Amy St, 2lots away. This area of Amy Sts already flooded during the
winter as the street is narrow and the plow pushes snow onto the sidewalks and the sidewalk plow pushes t back into
the street and covers the catch basins, Drainage ofthe parking area should be retained within the property of 241 Park
St

‘The wood fence proposed along the east property line Isa compromise tothe existing zoning by-law by not requiring a
buffer zone as was required in a eater site plan agreement at this property. The buffer zone could be less ofan Issue If
the wood fence was required to cover the fllength of the east commercial property line asthe plan shows an area at
the south end by the proposed waste enclosure where there i no fence shown along the property line. The fll
‘commercial property line should be fenced

‘The proposed waste enclosure is proposed to be only 1 meter from the property line, As the northside yard of the
building is consumed by this proposal it would be a better location for the waste enclosure onthe south side against the
building on either side ofthe existing wooden landing which accesses the commercial operation assoclated to tis
application.

Thank you forthe opportunity to comment on the Zoning By-Law Amendment for 241 Park St.

REPORT TO ECONOMIC DEV. & PLANNING COMMITTEE - JAN. 7, 2014

2014-03-01 C. J. COSGROVE, P.ENG.
ISLAND BREAKFAST DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
RECOMMENDED

THAT the Island Breakfast Committee be designated as a Committee of Council; and

THAT the 2014 Island Breakfast be designated as a City-sanctioned event.

PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this report is to recommend the actions necessary to have the Island
Breakfast covered by the City's municipal liability insurance.

BACKGROUND

‘The Island Breakfast was held for several years in conjunction with Riverfest. A committee
‘comprised of community volunteers and staff from Tourism and the Operations Department
desire to hold an event in 2014. The event provides an opportunity for the public to enjoy
breakfast on Refugee Island, and itis hoped that funds can be raised for a picnic shelter
on Refugee Island,

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS

‘The Committee has members responsible forall aspects of the event which is proposedto
beheld on June 25~28, 2014. A key consideration, however, is insurance coverage. The
Committee has requested that the event be covered under the City’s municipal lablity
Policy (Attachment 1),

The City’s insurer has confirmed that the event would be covered under the City’s policy if
the Committee is designated as a Committee of Council, and the event is designated as a
City-sanctioned event. The coverage would include the ownership, use or operation of any
watercraft up to 30 metres in length by or on behalf of the City. This is important as
Volunteers ferry participants to and from the island on private boats.

As the City’s deductible is $50,000, tis recommended that a special events rider be added
for this event, reducing the deductible to $500, for a cost of approximately $150. The cost
of the special events rider will be covered by event revenues.

Island Broakfast Page2

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘Council authorization is required to create a Committee of Council.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
‘As the event will cover the cost ofthe special events rider, there is no cost tothe City for
the event.

CONCLUSION

‘The Island Breakfast event should be supported by designating it as a City-sanctioned
event, and by designating the organizing committee as a Committee of Council.
