Attention: Andrew MeGinis, Planner
ne Wall street vilage: Zoning Amendment Application

Dear Andeew

We ae wing ths ete to accompany the application to amend the zoning forthe above noted
project. As requested, we are providing addtional ratonale fr the application.

[As you are aware, the Wall Stet United Church has worked on acquiring (withthe hope of
‘devoloping) the properties surrounding the church for many years. aéetion, they have
estabished 2 joint Board with the Marguecta Residential Corporation to provide 8S affordable
rental Housing wits on the lands adjacent to the church; 30 of which wil have thei ents
supplemented by the United Counties of Leeds Grenvle

Any affordable housing projec, must be constricted in 2 manner thats 26 cost efective as
possible. Ideal, there would be more landscaped space provided by a taller building with 3
smaler footprint; but there are efficiencies in scale and construction methodology, The
proposed building is si storeys in height; enabing the buiding to be constricted of
refabricated concrete floor slabs and load-bearing conerete bloc, rather than the much more
‘expensive poured cancrete option which would have been cequied for taller bugs.

‘AMfordable housing projects must also be laid out in as simple, and as regularized way as
possible; factoring in the unit mix required. Wall Steet Village has managed to ft in the
‘maximum allowable units (85), withthe aight mix of one and two bedroom units, within si
storeys, and with design that is rectangular ia nature with many standardized layouts,

Early on In the design process, the Board (especialy the Church) identified parking 25 9
significant issue, The church has limited parking, and viitors/employees connected with the
«courthouse often park on church property. The 8oard stressed the importance of maximising
patking paces forthe new senio’s apartments 35 wells ensuring there are enough spaces for
the church. Asa result the church ad the apartment residences have agreed to eter ito Joint
Use and Maintenance Agreements and establsh Right-oF Ways in order to mansmice the
parking. With the requested elimination of landscape buffers and setbacks for parking along
‘shared propery ines, and wah the reduction of landscape strips requied at street property
Snes, the Board can achieve 62 parking spaces forthe residence, and 14 addtional spaces for
the church, This arrangement allows the parking tobe contained between the church and the
‘ew residence, resulting inthe streetscape slong Wall, James St, and the comer at Vitoria
‘Ave, tobe free of cars. There will only be landscaping between the streets and the building.
