RECOMMENDATION:

THAT Report 2013-10-10 be received as information and that a report on this matter
be prepared by staff for consideration of the Economic Development Planning
Committee at a future meeting.

PURPOSE

To provide information for purposes of conducting a public meeting under the Planning
Act respecting an Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-
94,

BACKGROUND

The property known municipally as 260 King Street West is zoned C2D - General
‘Commercial Downtown Zone. Since 2007, under a site-specific zoning, a chip wagon
hhas been permitted as a temporary use on the subject lands. The approval for the
temporary use expired on 24 August 2013; therefore, the permission for the chip wagon,
is no longer in effect and the zoning on the subject property has reverted back to a
‘C2D-Commercial Downtown Zone.

‘The details of the site specific zone, which expired on 24 August 2013, are attached as
Schedule “A” to this report for information purposes.

McKercher Brothers Holdings Limited, owner of the subject lands has authorized Ms.
Cathy Couture and Ms. Nancy Ker to submit an application for amendment to City of
Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to reinstate a site specific zoning on the subject lands.
to allow a chip wagon as a temporary use for a three (3) year period.

Ms. Couture and Ms. Ker purchased the chip wagon from Mr. Massey. It has been
‘operating beside 260 King Street West since the fall of 2007.
