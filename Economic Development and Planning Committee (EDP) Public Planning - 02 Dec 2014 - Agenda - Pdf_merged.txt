Application for Amendment o Zoning By-Law 050-2014
ile D14-002 (050-2014) East Side of Center Street

My Wife and I both oppose the proposed plan of tubdivision and related zoning by-law
amendment pertaining tothe proposed construction af street townhouse dwelling units on the plot of
land labelled “9” onthe draft plan of subdivision of par of lots 15, 19 & 22, Registered Plan 206, City
of Brockville, County of Leeds.

‘The proposed townhouses would be across the street from single family dwellings and would be
adjacent to un existing single family dwelling. We believe it would be more appropriate tha there
should be a more gradual transition i.e. from single family dwellings to semi-detached dwellings to
townhouses. New townhouses should not be permitted to be constructed adjoining exiting single
family dwellings unless that zoning was in place atthe time ofthe construction of the single family

dwelling.
