202 Letter from Chair

‘What does $30.19 buy these days?

Since taking on the role of Chair of the Library Board in late January, 've more
than once been asked -"Why would you want to do that? Aren‘t libraries becoming
unnecessary these days?” Nothing could be further from the truth - our library is as
important and relevant today as it has ever been,

Your library is funded at a rate of $30.19 per person per year through City property
taxes. For less than the cost ofa night at the movies, Brockville’ citizens enjoy a
year of unlimited access ~ to information, ideas and entertainment; to facilities, com-
puters, e-books and databases; to spaces to gather, share and explore. Your library
a place where all are welcome; questions are asked and answered and opportunities
are pursued.

This year your BPL Board is developing a new strategic plan. We have completed a
comprehensive community needs assessment to inform and guide our planning pro-
cess. We are grateful to the many individuals, current library users and those who
are not, who took time to offer their thoughts and feedback on our services. The plan
will set the stage for our on-going evolution as a valued community hub and resource
centre for the next several years.

‘Thank you for your continued support of the Brockville Public Library. Let us help
you to discover, to learn, to grow, to enjoy ~it is your library ~ come and make the
‘most of

~ Leah Wales, Chair of the board
