known municipally as 2360 Parkedale Avenue, has submitted an application for
‘Amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014.

The proposed Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 would, if
approved, rezone lands with municipal address 2360 Parkedale Avenue (location of
Canadian Tire Store) to permit a Refreshment Vehicle as a permitted use for a three (3)
year period. The proposed Refreshment Vehicle is 20 feet in length by 8 feet in width
with signage “The Shady Coyote" on the side of the trailer. A photo of the existing
“Refreshment Vehicle” is attached as Schedule “A” to this report.

‘A ‘Refreshment Vehicle” has been permitted at 2360 Parkedale Avenue since 1996 as
a temporary use, the most recent of which will expire on 28 April 2018. The applicant is
requesting that a Refreshment Vehicle, proposed to be located along the Millwood
Avenue frontage of the subject property (indicated on Schedule “B"/Schedule “B-1”

ANALYSIS

Official Plan Designation; Mixed Use and Commercial Area with Mixed Use Node
provisions,

Existing Zoning T-€3-3 - General Commercial Arterial, Special Exception

Zone (expires 28 April 2018).

Proposed Zoning: T-C3-3 — General Commercial Arterial, Special Exception
Zone (to permit a "Refreshment Vehicle" for an additional
three (3) years, expiring spring 2021).

Site Characteristics
Total Area 25,030 m? /2.5 hectares (6.2 acres)
Frontage: Parkedale Avenue: 94,737 metres

Frontage - Millwood Avenue 173,049 metres

Frontage - Magedoma Boulevard: 113.872 metres

Average Width 135 metres

Average Depth: 489 metres

Total Parking Spaces on Site 303 spaces

Number of parking spaces to be
utilized for the Refreshment Vehicle: 6 spaces

‘The subject land is currently occupied by a Canadian Tire Store, associated parking and
landscaping, all of which was developed under two (2) Site Plan Control Agreements.

Based on the size of the retail space for the Canadian Tire Store and associated uses,
the required parking for the site is 290 spaces. As stated above, there are 303 spaces
on-site; therefore, utilization of six (6) spaces for the proposed refreshment vehicle and
accessory eating area will reduce the number of parking spaces to 297 spaces. With
this reduction, the on-site parking stil exceeds the minimum requirement.
