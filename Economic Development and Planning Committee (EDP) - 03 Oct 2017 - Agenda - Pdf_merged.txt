Proposed Amendment to Sign By-law 84-89

1770'Stewart Boulevard, Brockville

Applicant: Patlgon Signs ~ Dominic Rotundo

Oemer: 245591 Ontario Ltd,

Fle: 64-89-56

Based on available records, the proposed sign, if approved, would coincide with multiple
signs already looated within the Cty of Brockville. A key point that staff would ike to a bring
attention toi that this sign is proposed to advertise one (1) tenant, not muttiple tenants as
the other permitted signs within the City are (excluding Home Depot).

‘As the proposed sign does exceed the maximum sign area permitted, it should be noted
that the base/suppor ofthe sign is cladded to match the upper sign text area, technically
increasing the area of the sign. The "message" area of the sign would be in compliance
should the advertising area be considered on its own,

‘Should Council determine that the advertising area should be considered separately, the
area of advertising as shown measures 10.4 square metres, 25.8% of the proposed sign.
Itis therefore staffs recommendation that a maximum advertising area be imposed should
the proposed sign be approved. This restriction on advertising area is outined in the
recommendation section at the beginning ofthis report. Alternatively, should Council not
be in agreement with staff regarding the proposed recommendation, one (1) or two (2) of
the cladded panels could be removed to satisfy the by-law requirements. As Hyundai has
a corporate image that they wish to maintain, staff are unaware if this would cause any
issues with their corporate branding policies.

‘This application has been circulated for comment with the following results:

‘+ Planning Department-Building Division: no objection to the proposal. A permit is,
required prior to work commencing

‘+ Operations Department: no objection.

‘+ Brockville Fire Department: no concem (verbal)

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

None.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Allcosts for actions addressed under this report are the responsibilty of the Developer.

CONCLUSION:

‘The amendment isto to permit an oversized ground sign with a maximum sign area of
40.18 mé. As the proposed sign is advertising only one (1) tenant, staff believes that a
maximum advertising area on the sign should be imposed that satisfies the by-law
requirements measuring 27.75 m,n addition, as the proposed ground sign is similar to
other approved ground signs on iands within the City, staff have no concem with the
proposed increase, This conclusion is provided in the recommendations section of this
report
