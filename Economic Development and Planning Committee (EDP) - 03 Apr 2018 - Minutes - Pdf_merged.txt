Tourism Office Relocation
(Pat Markovich, Chamber of Commerce, President)

P. Markovich spoke to the Committee regarding the possibility of the
Tourism offices being relocated. She explained that their busiest time of
the year is just getting started and wanted to ensure that the relocation
would not take place during this time as it would be very disruptive.
