Economic Development and Planning (EDP) Committee Minutes -
Tuesday, July 07, 2015

Mr. McGinnis highlighted his report for the committee. Mr. McGinnis paid
specific attention to an exchange of lands with the Wall Street Church that is
different from the initial proposed project. Although he confirmed that the
concept still remains the same.

Mr. McGinnis noted that the bicycle parking that had been requested to be
reduced from 22 to 6 spots has been increased to 12.

Councillor Kalivas was not in favour of increasing the number of bike parking
spots as he feels that the target residents will not be riding bikes.

Councillor Bursey would like to see the number of bike parking spots remain
at 12 as he feels it is a good compromise from the initial requirement of 22.
