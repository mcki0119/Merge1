LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT STATEMENT
MAYOR'S REMARKS.

Mayor Wren offered condolences on behalf of City Council and himself to the
family and friends of Peter Hoogendam, who was a long time Brockville
businessman and mainstay of Downtown Brockville for decades. He will long be
remembered for his passion and supportiveness of Downtown Brockville and was
a tremendous contribution to the community. He will be greatly missed.

His Worship gave his sincere thanks to all those involved in the food drive and
fundraising for our local food bank this past weekend. In particular, to the
Brockville Rotary Clubs and MOVE Radio. It was a pleasure to join the on air
broadcast early Friday morning alongside our MP and MPP. He added that Rotary
has announced that almost 13,000 Ibs of food and nearly $33,000 in cash was
received.

Mayor Wren reported that beyond the food drive, there were a great many
thanksgiving meals served to those who were either alone or in need over the
weekend. Two events he was aware of included Richards Coffee House and the
Wall Street United Church. Special thanks to Sam Rawas, of Richard's Coffee
House and his staff, and all the volunteers who helped with both efforts.

His Worship shared that this coming Saturday is the George E. Smith Fire Truck
Pull another annual event in support of a great cause. In this case the YMCA of
Eastern Ontario ~ with the annual Mayor George Smith Fire Truck Pull. His
Worship noted that Mayor Smith was a tremendous supporter of the Y, and it

seems only fitting to assemble a team of local mayors to take part in the
festivities. Mayor Wren shared that he is being joined by Mayors Gauri Shankar,
Robin Jones, Arie Hoogenboom, Brant Burrow, Jeff Shaver, Tory Deschamps and
Mike Cameron and they will do our best to pull one of Brockville Fire
Departments rigs as fast as possible - while raising money for a great cause,
Any donations are appreciated!

Mayor Wren congratulated the 1000 Islands Ladies Chorus on their 50th
Anniversary which will be celebrated on Sunday. Yet another example of the
thriving organizations in our Arts and Culture circles.

In addition, the Brockville Operatic Society - School of Rock which runs from
October 11 to the October 14 is upcoming and the Mayor would like to extend
best wishes our colleague Councillor Wales and the Operatic Society as they take
to the Arts Centre Stage with School of Rock later this week.

His Worship communicated that today the City, the Employment & Education
Centre and Brockville General Hospital announced the launch of the “Brockville
Life” recruitment campaign designed to attract much needed health care
workers, including physicians, to our community.
