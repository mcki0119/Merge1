His Worship noted that on this past Sunday evening, the local Islamic Community
gathered to mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan and they did so for
the first time in their own place of worship ~ Brockville’s first ever mosque.

Mayor Wren said that since we last met, local Special Olympics Athlete Neal
Condron has returned from the games in Calgary where he won both a gold and
bronze medal in Nordic Skiing. We have invited Neal and his family to the March
26th Council meeting so we can provide recognition with all of Council in
attendance.

Brockville’s own Jacob Durepos has been selected to represent Canada at the
Junior World Slopestyle and Big Air competition in Italy which takes place from
March 22 - 30 and of course we all join together in wishing him well and will be
cheering him on.
