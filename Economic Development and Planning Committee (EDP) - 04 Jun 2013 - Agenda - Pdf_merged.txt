RECOMMENDATION:

‘THAT Zoning By-law 194-94 be amended to rezone the rear half of the property located
at 10/12 Delhi Street from R3 — General Residential Zone to C2 - General Commercial
Zone.

PURPOSE
‘The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations on an application for

amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 respecting the properties at
10/12 Delhi Street and 152 Perth Street.

BACKGROUND

Mr. Robert J. Jordan, Jordan and Wiseman Surveying Ltd., on behalf of Four-O-One
Security Lid., owners of lands described as Lots 3, 4 and 14, Block 50, Plan 67, City of
Brockville, County of Leeds, municipal address 10/12 Delhi Street and 152 Perth Street
(as shown on Schedule “A"), has submitted an application for an amendment to
Zoning By-law 194-94 which would, if approved, rezone 152 Perth Street and the rear
Portion of 10/12 Delhi Street to permit the lands at the rear of 10/12 Delhi Street to be
severed and added to 182 Perth Street.

10/12 Delhi Street currently contains a duplex dwelling and is situated on a long narrow
lot backing onto Buells Creek. Currently the rear of the property is being utilized as a
gravel parking lot and in use by staff of Four-O-One Security. This parking area has
been in place for multiple years however without municipal approvals. The owners
would now like to sever the lands from 10/12 Delhi and add the portion of the parking
area to 152 Porth Stroct.

Through the application for rezoning, it was also requested that the parking area be
permitted to remain as a gravel parking lot through the creation of a special exception
zone which would apply to 152 Perth Street and the rear of 10/12 Delhi Street.

Development and Planning Commitiee. Notice of the Public Meeting was advertised in
the Brockvile Recorder and Times Newspaper on 11 Apil 2013 and was circulated to
Property owners within 120.0 metres (400.0 f) of the subject property. In addition,

1. Steve Allen, Supervisor of Engineering, Environmental Services Department:

+ Does not support the application as all permanent commercial parking lots
are to be paved with curbing,

2 Conal Cosgrove, Director of Operations
+ No objections to the proposed severance; however, recommends a paved
surface due to dust concems and tracking of gravel onto public roads that
‘often occurs with gravel parking lots.
3. Brent Caskenette, Chief Building Official, Planning Department:

‘If the outbuilding that is to be relocated exceeds 108 square feet, a
Building Permit will be required.

‘Schedule “D” to this report)

‘= No objection to the application provided that the proposed parking lot be
subject to Site Plan Control and is to be completed to the satisfaction of
the City of Brockville and CRCA. The site plan application must address

ANALYSIS.

Provincial Policy Considerations:

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2005 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
consistent with” the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of potential
Provincial interest.

Section 1.1.3.1 states that “Settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and their
vitality and regeneration shall be promoted’.

‘Section 1.1.3.2 states that "Land use patterns within settioment areas shail be based
on
a, densities and a mix of land uses which:
a. efficiently use land and resource
. are appropriate for, and efficiently use, the infrastructure and public
service facilities which are planned or available, and avoid the need
for their unjustified and/or uneconomical expansion; and
‘c. minimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, and
promote energy efficiency in accordance with policy 1.8; and
b. a range of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
accordance with the criteria in policy 1.1.3.3."

40/12 Delhi Streot & 152 Perth Street, City Of Brockville

‘Owner: Four-0-One Security Systems Lid.

File: 014-165

Section 1.1.3.3 states that “Planning Authorities shall identify and promote opportunities
for intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated taking into
account existing building stock or areas, including Brownfield sites, and the availabilty
Of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facities required to
accommodate projected needs.”

Section 1.3.1 sates that “Planning authorties shall promote economic development
‘and competitiveness by:

1. providing for an appropriate mix and range of employment (including industrial,
Commercial and institutional uses) to meet long-term needs;

2. providing opportunites for a diversified economic base, including maintaining a
range and choice of suitable sites for employment uses which support a wide
range of economic activities and ancillary uses, and take into account the needs
of existing and future businesses;

3. planning for, protecting and preserving employment areas for current and future
uses; and

4, ensuring the necessary infrastructure 's provided to support current and
projected needs.

Section 1.6.5.4 speaks to a land use pattern, density and mix of uses that minimize the
‘number of vehicle trips and supports the development of viable choices and plans for
public transit and other alternative transportation modes.

The overall proposal represents intensification and revitalization of the existing land
stock within close proximity to the Downtown core. No change to existing municipal
infrastructure will be needed. The proposal will also support the needs of an existing
business within the City of Brockville.

Through the Site Plan Control Approval process that will be required should the
application be approved, protection of the creek area to the north of the parking area
will be reviewed and enforced by the Conservation Authority (CRCA)

Oficial Plan Considerations

The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
‘growth, development, and change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Plan designates the subject properties as “Neighbourhood Area & Corridor
Commercial Area within the Mixed Use Corridor’.

‘The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned,

40/12 Delhi Street & 152 Perth Street, City Of Brockville

Owner: Four-0-One Security Systems Ltd.

File: Di4-165

Section 2.3 outlines strategic planning themes which includes "A Sustainable, Healthy,
‘and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, "A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities", and “A Well-Planned and Responsive City’

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. More specifically,
Sections 3.2.2.1, 3.2.4.1 and 3.2.4.3 outline policies for the scope of development within
"Neighbourhood Areas and Corridor Commercial Area within the Mixed Use Corridor’ as
focusing on a mix of employment, retail commercial, hoteV/motel accommodations,
‘community uses, and mixed density residential uses. These sections also promote low
to medium density housing, infiling on existing lots of record and the rounding-out of
existing development patterns while ensuring that the character of the neighbourhood is
preserved

‘Accordingly, no change to the Official Plan is required to consider the proposed
rezoning for expansion of a parking area associated with an existing business at 152
Perth Street and severance of the rear lands at 10/12 Delhi Street to be added to 152
Perth Street.

Zoning By-law Considerations:

‘The current zoning on the property with municipal address 10/12 Delhi Street is R3—
General Residential Zone under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-04, as amended.

‘The amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-04, as requested, seeks to
rezone the rear portion of 10/12 Delhi Street to a zoning consistent with the adjacent
lands at 152 Perth Street, which, according to the application, would be a new C2-
General Commercial Special Exception zone, allowing for all C2 uses and the retention
of a gravel surface for the existing expanded parking area.

‘At the Public Meeting on 7 May 2013, Mr. Moss expressed the intention of the owner of
the property to pave the lot in the future. A further meeting was then held between
Planning Staff, the owner and the applicant to discuss the future intention for the lot.
‘The owner has subsequently withdrawn his request for site specific zoning to allow for
the parking area to remain gravel and will pave the parking area in the future,

Parking lot development is subject to Site Plan Approval. The CRCA has noted issues
to be addressed through the Site Plan Approval process. Once the CRCA and City are
‘satisfied on the design elements for the paved parking lot, specific timelines on paving
ccan be established through Site Pian Control Approval and the associated agreement.
‘The applicant is requesting up to 24 months for completion of the paved parking area.

It Is appropriate to rezone the rear portion of 10/12 Delhi Street to C2-General
‘Commercial Zone, consistent with the zoning on the property at 152 Perth Street, which
then would provide for consistent zoning for consideration of a lot addition to 152 Perth

‘Street through consent. and for completion of construction of an expanded parking area
for the business at 152 Perth Street, being Four-o-One Security.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.
‘As noted in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed amendment to Zoning By-

law 194-04 for 10/12 Delhi Street is consistont with the PPS and with the relevant
Policies of the City's Offical Plan.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

‘All costs associated with the requested rezoning of the subject property are the
responsibilty of the Owner.

‘Should the request for establishment of a C2 - General Commercial Zone be approved
for the rear lands of 10/12 Delhi Street, consideration of a concurrent application for
consent to sever wil proceed. With a land severance, MPAC will adjust the current
value assessment which potentially will alter the taxation generated from the property,
when the rear lands are added to 152 Perth Street.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for zoning amendment for 10/12 Delhi Street, itis reasonable to
amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to rezone the rear portion of 10/12 Delhi
Street consistent with the zoning on 152 Perth Street, being C2-General Commercial
Zone, as set out in the recommendation at the beginning of this repor.

‘Waterboy: Butlers Creek

‘Swf of the Cataragui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) have reviewed the sbove-noted
_pplcations and provide the following comment.

‘Sammary of Proposal

‘The proposal involves the severance of approximately 476.4 m of land from an existing 1,016 mi
residential lo with frontage on Dethi Sweet andthe addition ofthe severed land to an adjacent 865
commercial property to the eas, with frontage on Perth Steet. The intent isto enlarge the exiting
‘commercial propery by means of lot addition in orgerto provide additional parking.

“The proposal also involves change in zoning forthe proposed land to be severed from residential to
comrerial in onder to permit the proposed use. The lands o be retained Would remain sx residential. The
‘pplicantis also seeking an exemption from the City of Brockwile's paved parking requirement (Section
37 (@) ofthe Zoning By-law) inorder to allow the additional parking to consist ofa gravel surface

Site Description

‘The subject lands are located north of Dethi Steet and west of Perth Street and are adjacent to Butlers
reek: The property at 10 & 12 Delhi Steet (otto be severed and lotto be retained) i currently
developed witha | and half storey, to unit apartment and accessory residential structures. The eat of
the property, whichis sabject tothe severance is curently vacant and consists of mown lawn and gravel
surface parking. The propery at 152 Perth Stet (lotto be enlarged) is curently developed with 2 (Wo

‘The topography of the subject lands is generally flat withthe exception of a steep, till embankment
adjacent to Butlers Creek. The embankment ison average 3m in eight and is vegetated with mature
ecidvous tees

Discussion

‘The main interests ofthe CRCA inthis aplication ae the avoidance of natural hazards associated with
‘Balers Creek and the protection of the water quality of the creek through the provision of adequate
somwater management and sediment and erosion contls,

‘Natural Hazan
Flooding Hazard

‘The CRCA as engineered flood plain mapping for the BuellsButles Creck system in the City of
Brockville (Crysler & Lather, 1983) The extent of the regulatory fod plain (1:100 year level) a the
Tocation of the subject lands is anticipated to reach an elevation of 8.8 m GSC.

‘The CRCA, in accordance with Ontario Regulation 148/06: Development. Interference with Wetlands &
Alterations'to Shorelines and Watercourses, consistent withthe natural hazards policies of the 2005
Provincial Policy Statement, restricts development and site alteration within and adjacent lands subject
to flood risk. Any proposed development aad sit alteration (including placement of fil, excavation and
‘grading) within 1S m of the flood plain is regulated by the CRCA. As per the CRCA Guidelines for
Implementing Ontario Regulation 14806, development and site alteration must beset bck a minimum of
6m horizontal from the regulatory flood plain.

‘Based on our review of relevant LiDAR information and aerial imagery, the flood plain of Butlers Creek
‘would be contained within the channel embankments. Maintenance of 6 m st back between the 1p of
the embankment and all development will ensure that safe ingrssiegres is provided uring 8 :100 Year
‘ood event.

Erosion Hazard

‘The CRCA defines the extent ofthe erosion hazard, otherwise known asthe ‘erosion hazard imi within
8 define river or sveam valley system to be the sum of a 3h): I(v) stable slope allowance plus a 6m
erosion acees allowance,

‘As note, the average height of the creek embankment athe rear ofthe subject ands is 3 m. As such, the
‘rosion hazard limit extends approximately 15 m from the to of slope ofthe river embankment iland. fn
other words, the predicted long term erosion hazard would consist ofall lands within 10 m back fom the

Development and site alteration (including the stivtes listed above) are prohibited within the erosion

‘Stormwater Management and Sediment and Erosion Controls

Staff are concerned with impacts to water quality and flood risk associated with Butlers Creek asa rest
‘of having vehicular parking located in close proximity tothe watercourse. AL present, stormwater rapt!
A he ste of the proposed parking extension discharges untreated directly into the creck,

In our review of planning spplications, the CRCA typically requires both quality and quantity stormwater
‘management controls tobe implemented forall new development that would result inthe conversion of
‘pemeable surface to impermeable surface. The method to demonstrate the necessary level of stormwater
management required and how it will be achieved is through a Stormwater Management Report by a

management brief

Staff recognize thit an elaborate on-site stormwater management facility, such as a pond, ol-it
‘separator or storage chamber is not practical given the scale of development and space limitations.
However, de othe close proximity to the ereck and the existing drainage conditions itis important to
‘ensure that controls are provided. One practical option may be to construct = grassed swale slong the
perimeter ofthe proposed parking area's that ranofT is redirected away from the creek allowing for
Inflation prior o release back into the creek. Sizing and design requirements for a swale would be a
function ofthe size, configuration and surface material type ofthe parking area. Staff recommend thatthe
parking be maintained as gravel. However, in recognition of the City’s zoning provisions, should the
‘arking are be required to be paved a greater level of stormwater control wil be necessary

Without further infomation relating 1 the design and layout of the parking area, staff cannot provide
specifi etal for stormwater management requieents at his time. In order to ensure that appropriate
‘slormvater management is provided andthe hazard issues discussed above are addressed, we recommend
thatthe proposed parking area extesion be subject to site plan control. During the site plan contol
application process, we request that the applicant sabmit drawings for the parking extension and
‘demonsrate how both stormwater quality and quantity controls wil be provided tothe stisfction of the
(City and CRCA.

Public Participation

‘The application for Zoning By-law Amendment has proceeded through the normal
review process. On 7 May 2013, a Public Meeting was held by the Economic
Development and Planning Committee. Notice of the Public Meeting was advertised in
the Brockville Recorder and Times Newspaper on 07 April 2013 and was circulated to
property owners with 120.0 metres (400.0 feet) of the subject property. In addition, a
sign was posted on the subject property advising that the lands are the subject of an
Application for Amendment to the City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94. Comments
from City Departments and affected agencies wero also solicited. A copy of an excerpt
{rom the minutes of the Public Meeting is attached as Schedule “C” to this report.

‘Comments Received

‘The following is a summary of comments received following the circulation of the Notice
of Public Meeting:

1. Greg Healey, Fire Prevention Officer:
“After reviewing the application for the above-noted project, please be advised
that this Department has no fire safety concems at this time.

2. C. Cosgrove, P. Eng., Director of Operations:
“The Operations Department has no comments with respect to the application.”

3. Steve Allen, Supervisor of Engineering
"We are not opposed to this request.”

Provincial Policy Statement Considerations:

‘A Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) 2005 has been issued under the authority of
Section 3 of the Planning Act. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of
Provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the
Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be
consistent with" the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial
interest. Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under
consideration, and thus, only those relevant portions will be referenced below.

Section 1.1.3.1 states that “Settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and their
vitality and regeneration shall be promoted”

£88 Church, Cty of Brockville

(Owner: Russell & Virginia Armitage

Applicant: David Duc

File: Di4-166

Section 1.1.3.2 states that “Land use pattems within settlement areas shall be based
on:
densities and a mix of land uses which:
2. efficiently use land and resources;
». are appropriate for, and efficiently use, the infrastructure and public
‘service facilties which are planned or available, and avoid the need
{or their unjustified and/or uneconomical expansion; and
cc. minimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, and
promote energy efficiency in accordance with policy 1.8; and
b. arrange of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
accordance withthe eriteria in policy 1.1.3.3."

Section 1.1.3.3 states that "Planning Authorties shall identify and promote opportunities
for intensification and redevelopment where this can be accommodated taking into
‘account existing building stock or areas, including Brownfield sites, and the availabilty
Of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilities required to
‘accommodate projected needs.”

Section 1.4.3 states, among others, that ‘Planning authorities shall provide for an
appropriate range of housing types and densities to meet projected requirements of
current and future residents of the regional market area by:
b. Permitting and faciitating:
1. all forms of housing required to meet social, heath and well-being
requirements of current and future residents; and,
2, all forms of residential intensification and redevelopment in
accordance with policy 1.1.33
4. Promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources,
infrastructure and public service faites, and support the use of
alternative transportation modes and public transit in areas where if exists
oris to be developed.

Section 1.6.5.4 speaks to a land use patter, density and mix of uses that minimize the
‘number of vehicle trips and supports the development of viable choices and plans for
public transit and other alternative transportation modes.

The overall proposal represents intensification within close proximity to the Downtown
core. No change to existing municipal infrastructure is proposed. The proposal will add
to the mix of housing types within the area and allow for visitors to select altemative
‘means of transportation should the clients of the bed and breakfast choose, as they are
within close proximity of the Red Bus route, the Brock Trail and Downtown.

Official Ptan Considerations

‘The Official Plan for the City of Brockville provides guidance on how to manage future
‘growth, development, and change within the City of Brockville

‘The Official Plan designates the subject property as "Neighbourhood Area’.

The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
amenities, and is well planned.

Section 2.3 outtines strategic planning themes which includes “A Sustainable, Healthy,
‘and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, "A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities’, and “A Well-Planned Responsive City’.

‘The proposed intensification achieves the above objectives. The proposal legally
Intensifies an existing, serviced lot within the urban area; and, is located within walking
distance of a number of amenities, services, and recreational facilities that meet clients’
dally needs.

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. More specifically,
Sections 3.2.4.1 and 32.4.3 outine policies for the scope of development within
"Neighbourhood Areas” as focusing on low to medium density housing, infiling on
existing lots of record and the rounding-out of existing development patterns while
ensuring that the character of the neighbourhoods is preserved. More specifically
various forms of residential intensification such as infiling and the creation of accessory
dwelling units are to be encouraged, where appropriate. These general Neighbourhood
‘Area policies are further refined under Section 3.2.4.3 wherein small scale residential
intensffcation is permitted in all Neighborhood Areas where infrastructure is adequate
land where there are no significant physical constraints.

The general Neighbourhood Area policies are further refined under Section 4.3.2

wherein “Bed and Breakfast establishments shall be permitted’. Furthermore, Section

4.3.33 states that “A Bed and Breakfast Establishment shall only be operated in a

single detached dwelling for temporary accommodation, and shall be subject to criteria
1e Zoning By-law”.

The proposed development satisfies all the criteria required within the Official Pian.
Zoning By-taw Considerations:

The current zoning on the property with municipal address 89 Church Street is R4-X2-8
‘Special Exception Zone under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94, as amended.

Proposed Amendment to Zoning By-Law 194-04

£89 Church, City of Brockville

‘Owner: Russell & Virgiala Armitage

‘Applicant: David Due

File: Did-168

The requested Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 would, if
‘approved, rezone the subject lands to add a two (2) suite bed and breakfast use in
addition to the current uses permitted in the R4-X2-8 Zone in effect for 89 Church Street
and a reduction in required open space from 40% to 30% to recognize existing
Conditions. The current special exception zone was introduced in 2004 in response to a
Previous application to change the zoning on the subject property from 12-X2-2-
Institutional Residence Special Exception Zone (former use as Interval House).

ln considering the current application for zoning amendment, the following items were
considered:

1. Request for a two (2) suite Bed and Breakfast:

Under the current site specific zoning for 89 Church Street, limited uses are permitted
to occur. The uses permitted are restricted to a maximum of two dwelling units, a
home occupation and a private home day nursery only. If the property was not under
its current site specific zoning, a Bed and Breakfast containing up to five (5)
bedrooms would be a permitted use in the R4 Zone. Therefore, based on the request
and the polices of the Official Plan, staff bolieves that permitting a full bed and
breakfast establishment within 89 Church Street rather than limiting the applicant to
oly the two (2) rooms would be a logical change and provide the owners with more
opportunity.

For consistent implementation of Policy 4.3.3.3 of the Official Plan, a Bed and
Breakfast establishment can only operate should the existing building on the property
be a single detached dwelling (one unit) rather than two dwelling units as is also
permitted through the current zoning. Should the owner decide to utilize available
Zoning regulations and establish two separate dwellings on the property, a Bed and
Breakfast could not operate in either of the two (2) dwellings.

2. Reduction to Open Spac

Zoning by-law 194-94 requires that a minimum of 40% of the lot be maintained as
‘open space. Upon inspection, it was noted that a rear deck was constructed without
obtaining the proper building approvals and therefore has reduced the open space
available on the lot. A request has been made by the applicant to reduce the
‘minimum open space required from 40% to 30% to recognize the existing condition.

Planning Staff support the proposed request for a reduction to the open space;
however, recommend that the owner obtain a building permit to legalize the rear
deck.

‘Should the recommendations above be accepted by Council, the current R4-X2-8 Zone
would be amended and would read similar to the following:

"REX28

The uses permitted in the R4-X2-8 Zone shall be a maximum of two (2) dwelling
units, a home occupation, private home daycare and a bed and breakfast
establishment. Said Bed and Breakfast Establishment can only operate within a
Single Detached Dwelling only.

The zone provisions for the R4-X2-8 Zone shall be the same as for the R4
Zone, save and except a minimum of 30% open space must be maintained.”

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

‘As noted in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed amendment to Zoning By-
law 194-94 for 89 Church Street is consistent with the PPS and with the relevant
Policies of the City’s Oficial Plan.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.

All costs associated with the requested rezoning of the subject property are the
responsibility of the Owner.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS and the Official Plan, as well as the submissions received
respecting the request for a zoning amendment for 89 Church Street, it is reasonable to
amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 194-94 to permit the addition of a bed and
breakfast as a permitted use at 89 Church Street. It is also reasonable to recognize a
‘minimum 30% of open space to recognize existing conditions on the site as set out in
the recommendation at the beginning of this report and as noted in the proposed site
‘specific zoning included in this report.

2013-075-06 N.WooD.
BROCKVILLE MUSEUM CURATORIDIRECTOR
REQUEST FOR TRANSFER

‘OF FUNDS

RECOMMENDED

‘THAT Council authorize the transfer, to a maximum of $3,260, from the Brockville Museum Reserve
Fund (account 02-5-191954-6436) to be used for the preservation of historical Brockville fm,

PURPOSE

To have Council approve the transfer from the Brockville Museum Reserve Fund to cover the costs
associated with the preservation of archival film footage of Brockville.

BACKGROUND and ANALYSIS.

‘Over the past year the museum's film and media archives have grown substantially and volunteers
have been working to preserve these unique and exciting treasures, including 35 reels of home
videos in rare colour format film from the 1930s-1950s, and making them accessible to the public.
However, current museum resources only allow for sporadic digitization and cataloguing of these
materials. In keeping with our responsibilty as a museum, it is imperative that these records be
preserved before these films and tapes degrade to the point in which they are unusable.

‘The project being proposed involves the digitization of the museum's film and media collection in an
efficient and systematic way that would include a searchable and up-to-date catalogue. The media
files would be stored on the museum's back-up drive and a DVD version would be produced for use
in museum exhibitions and outreach activities. An instructional manual would also be developed in
‘order to assist museum staff and volunteers with maintaining the catalogue in the future.

‘The Museum has the equipment needed for this project and to avoid the risks associated with
‘sending the materials offsite, itis being recommended to hire Andrew Covert, a fim specialist from
Concordia University. Mr. Covert is an experienced professional in the field of film and digital
technology, who, through previous volunteer work at the museum, has proven himself to be reliable
and cognizant of the nuances of archival work. Mr. Covert is willing to complete the project onsite at
«a cost of $16.00 per hour with the Museum providing the matertals and equipment (ancilary cost of
'$260), for a total project cost of $3,260. Oral quotes were sought from Ottawa-based Home Video
Studios and from Spencerville-based New Found Memories (detalis below). Neither of these
‘companies are able to produce the instructional manual, and in both cases the museum's films would
have to be removed from the museum, risking damage.

‘Suppliers of digitization services who meet museums standards as set by the Ministry of Tourism and
Culture are very limited. By not meeting the museum standards, not only is the integrity of
Brockville's Archival collection compromised, but it may impact the museum's ability to obtain grant
monies.

REPORT TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING COMMITTEE ~ 4 JUNE
2013

2013-076.06

PROPOSED USE OF MUNICIPAL BUILDING M, PASCOE MERKLEY
FOR HOMELESS SHELTER, DIRECTOR OF PLANNING.
1807 COUNTY ROAD 2 EAST, ELIZABETHTOWN-KITLEY J. FAURSCHOU
APPLICANT: FRESH WIND COMMUNITY RESIDENCE INC. PLANNER |
RECOMMENDATIONS.

1. THAT the proposal from Fresh Wind Community Residence inc., attached to Report
2013-076-06 requesting use of the former WPCC administration building at 1807
‘County Road 2 East as a homeless shelter be received, and

2. THAT Fresh Wind Community Residence inc. be advised that the City of Brockville
views the request as being premature at this time,

PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this report is to respond to 2 proposal received from Fresh Wind
‘Community Residence Inc. asking for the City's contribution towards the establishment of a
homeless shelter at 1807 County Road 2, the former administration building associated
with the City’s Water Pollution Control Centre,

BACKGROUND

(On March 25, 2013, Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. submitted a proposal for the
establishment of a Brockville Homeless Shelter using the underutilized municipal building
att807 County Road 2 East. The facility would provide short term, safe, supportive
‘emergency shelter for people who are homeless or a risk of being homeless. The Proposal
Is attached hereto as Schedule “A”.

To achieve this, Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. is seeking a partnership wih local
churches, community agencies and service clubs, under the leadership and oversight of
The Pier Christian Church in the founding and on-going operation of a homeless shelter.

The contribution to this i

lative being sought from the City of Brockville is as follows:

‘+ The City of Brockville to provide the use of the building, rent free fora period of five
years. At the end of five years, an equitable rent would be negotiated by both
parties

+ The City of Brockville would make any necessary repairs as demanded fo comply
with Fire Department, building by-law, or hydro requirements.

Proposed Homeless Shelter
Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc.

‘+ The City of Brockville to continue to mow the lawns and remove snow as needed.

Coincidental with submission of this proposal to the City, Fresh Wind Community
Residence inc. also applied to the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville (UCLG) for One-
‘Time Transition Funding under the Community Homelessness Prevention initiative (CHP).
City staff has subsequently been advised that the funding request has been denied, and
that no other commitment, financial or otherwise, has been made by the UCLG.

Mr. Bill Burgess, who represents Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc., has advised that
the organization continues to seek the City's commitment while continuing to seek out
alternate sources of funds for this initiative,

ANALYSIS

‘There are several issues to be considered in response to the proposal by Fresh Wind
Community Residence Inc. This analysis will ouch on the following: Need; Proposed
Facility; Business and Operational Plan; and Municipal Participation.

Nood

‘A need for a homeless shelter has not yet been determined. The UCLG is currently
developing a ten year Housing and Homelessness Pian to address housing needs and
services currently provided in Leeds Grenvile, identifying gaps in services and establishing
goals and actions. Once complete, this Plan may support the notion that a homeless
shelter is needed.

Proposed F: County Road 2 East, Elizabethtown
‘General Building Description
‘* Owned by the City of Brockville.

Built in 1960's for Children’s Aid and later converted to offices and labs for use by
the City of Brockville in association with the WPCC.

‘+ The basement has full kitchen capability, men’s and women’s showers, lockers and
bathrooms.

‘+ Each upper floor has @ 2 piece bathroom.

* Brick exterior over painted concrete block interior with concrete ceilings, mix of
‘carpet and tile flooring

+ Dated individual window unit heaters/air conditioning units.

+ Anexterior retrofit elevator has been decommissioned. Formerty the elevator served
to transfer clients from the basement level to 1" level reception area.

+ With the completion of the WPCC Secondary Treatment and associated upgrades,
the future use ofthis underutlized building has not been addressed nor determined.

Zoning:
ibject property is located within the Township of Elizabethtown-Kitley and thus, its


Page 41 of 49
2013-076.06 Page 3

Proposed Homeless Sheltor

Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc.

Use is govemed by the Township's Official Plan and zoning by-law.

‘The subject property is not currently zoned for the intended use. In

regard, the
Director of Planning Barbara Kalivas has provided the following insight:

“if such a use were to be under the direct controVoperation of a public authority, €.9. the
City, it could be perhaps considered a public use, under the pending new zoning by-law
4 zone.

Ifitis however operated by another group, merely using the City’s facility (or part
thereof), it would need to be rezoned to permit a ‘shelter’ use (which | suspect
‘may be the case here). The pending new zoning by-law does not provide for such a
definition, so we would need to research this use and seek out an
‘appropriate/applicable definition. Might there be counselling services also offered to
those being housed on such a temporary basis? fs, this type of accessory use would
‘need to be captured in the definition. To control the scale ofthe proposed use, such a
definition might also reasonably limit the number of beds perhaps, given the
demonstrated need for such a use in the immediate area.

Certainly there would be building code/fie code implications with such occupancy and
also if there is potential for combined residential (e.g. lower floor) with commercial use
(e.g. offices on the upper fioor(s))in the balance of the building, but I've not had the
‘opportunity to consult with our Building Official or Fire Chief at this time.”

Site and/or Building Uparades:
‘The proposal suggests that the City of Brockville would undertake upgrades necessary for
homeless shelter occupancy. This is expected to include, at a minimum, the following:

4. Record of Site Condition

Given the proposed change of use from an institutional use to a more sensitive use
(residential), a Record of Site Condition may be required before any building permits
Can be issued. A Record of Site Condition (RSC) Is a statement filed by a Qualified
Person (QP) to protect property owners from environmental cleanup orders and it must
be filed whenever a property changes to a more sensitive use. In order to file an RSC,
the property must have been property assessed and shown to meet the sol, sediment
and groundwater standards appropriate forthe use (e. residential) proposed to take
place on the property. The Environmental Protection Act (EPA), specifically O. Reg.
153/04 passed under authority of the EPA, details requirements related to site
assessment and potential remediation.

2. Ontario Building Code (OBC) Compliance

‘AChange of Use Permit may be required as will a Building Permit for any work needed
to meet requirements under the OBC for residential occupancy ofthis nature. The City's
Chief Building Official has advised that, under the OBC, occupancy of a building by
more than 10 individuals would require, among potentially other items, a sprinkler
system and fire detection measures.

Proposed Homeless Shelter
Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc.

The potential costs associated with the above items could be considerable, but are
unknown at this time.

Location
1807 County Road 2 Eastis an inferior choice with respect to potentially suitable locations
for a homeless shelter, given its remote distance from the City centre. While Brockville
Transit services the area, the system has limited hours of operation. Walking distances.
may deter potential clients from using the shelter. Opportunities to access essential and
‘supporting services are also limited in the area, Police response, if needed, would be the
OPP rather than Brockville Police Service.

Business and Operational Plan

‘The Brockville Homeless Shelter Proposal identifies the following commitment from Fresh
‘Wind Community Residence Inc.:

+ Make any interior alterations (subject to approval by the City) and furnish the
building at their own expense. (Estimate $8,900.00 plus telephone, computers,
electrical and plumbing to be done by others);

+ Pay any necessary staffing costs and recruit volunteers to assist in the operation of
the shelter;

* Develop programs and liaise with various social services agencies to meet the
noods of residents;

+ Pay forall supplies and equipment needed to operate the shelter;

+ Pay the costs of hydro and water and sewage forthe operation of the facility

‘The Proposal does not identify any commitments in terms of financial support, one time
start-up and capital or ongoing, from the UCLG, Provincial agencies, Federal agencies,
‘surrounding townships, surrounding communities, churches or services clubs.

Other deficiencies which are of note with respect to the proposal are as follows:

* Lack of specifics regarding legislative requirements conceming the operation of a
homeless sheltr;

+ Incomplete financial pian;

Lack of secure partner commitments;
Lack of qualified Manager and commitment to staffing — fulltime / parttime /
volunteer;

+ Lack of security planning for building access/egress and within building;

+ Lack of clear daly operational structure, including but not limited to: hours of
operation, curfew, infout monitoring, time of occupancy (who can stay inside and for
how long ~allday occupation vs. restricted hours / procedures to address inclement
weather / emergency procedures, tc.)

++ Lack of focused clientele (men, women, families, transients passing through, city,
residents, residents of surrounding areas, those made homeless through calamity,

Proposed Homeless Shelter

Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc.

residents who cannot afford a room or apartment or who have been evicted,
recently paroled individuals, referrals from Canadian Mental Health or other social
agencies);
Lack of clear food preparation/serving/access procedures;
‘Lack of clear planning for client transportation; and

‘* Lack of consideration for insurance (building, health, etc.)

n

Besides its partnership in St. Lawrence Lodge under the Homes for the Aged Act, the City
of Brockville has no direct mandate respecting social housing. The UCLG is responsible in
this regard, with the City only indirectly involved with the provision of social housing as a
member of the Joint Services Committee of the UCLG.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The City's Community Strategic Plan does not identify as an initiative the provision of social
housing or specifically a homeless shelter to serve the community.

However, the Official Plan does set out in policy that the provision of housing that is
‘affordable to low and moderate income households shall be a priory. The Official Plan
further suggests that a housing strategy shall be completed to estat an appropr
target for the provision of housing to be affordable to low and moderate income
households. inthis vain, the City supports, as a fist ste, the work underway by the UCLG.
to update its ten year Housing and Homelessness Plan to provide guidance on spectic
housing-related issues, including the determination of need for a homeless shelter.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

The City's 2013 budget has been approved, and funds for repurposing the building at 1807
County Road 2 East have not been made availabe.

CONCLUSION:

Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. is to be commended on its initiative in responding
to a perceived need for a homeless shelter.

However, based on the foregoing information and analysis, staff believe that it is
premature to consider entering into an arrangement for re-use of this City facility for a
homeless shelter until the UCLG Housing and Homelessness Plan has been completed
and there has been a determination as to the need for such a shelter.

‘Should Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. continue to pursue an interest in such a
facility, the group should be encouraged to produce a complete and viable business pian
prepared by a qualified professional.

Furthermore, specific to the location of interest to this group, the City should determine the
future of this building, and whether itis clearly surplus to our needs, before committing to
another purpose.

SCHEDULE “A” — Report 2013-076-06

Brockville Homeless Shelter Proposal

Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc{ under the leadership at
of The Pier Christian Church ) would like to partner with the City of,
Brockville in order to provide short term, safe ,supportive emergency
shelter for people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless.

Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc seeks to form a partnership of local
churches, community agencies and service clubs who have purposely
come together to accomplish this task.

Mission

‘The partnership, with leadership from The Pier Christian Church seeks to
pull together the community resources to serve the individual needs of the
homeless in Leeds and Grenville and help people move forward in their
lives by connecting them with the services needed to accommodate the
Process.

‘As partners working together, we would provide a safe healthy community
in a shelter that will support the diverse needs of individuals and be
available to them as they move forward to stable long term housing in the
‘community.
‘Acceptance — Integrity — Faith - Accountability - Client Centered
- = Faith - Accour - entered —
‘Community
Respect - Confidentiality
The Need
‘* United Counties have 667 rent geared to income social housing units
‘+ United Counties of Leeds and Grenville Social Housing have 490
families on a waiting list affordable housing.
* A projection of 605 units/year is needed to accommodate growth.
‘+ United Counties have one emergency apartment that is always full
* Leeds and Grenville Mental Health Residential Services have one
bed for emergency use —it is always full as well.

Page 46.0149,

+ Homeless individuals have been bussed to shelters in other cities to
provide for their needs in the past. Numbers of men bussed to other
shelters have been minimum because most women are
accommodated here in Interval House and many men choose to
sleep on someone's couch or floor rather than leave their community.
The risk for Interval House may be filing spots used for women who
are homeless and possibly taking spaces that would be needed by
others who are experiencing abuse.

Clients to be Served
Residents would need to be at least 16 years of age ( Children’s Aid
Society would service those who are younger ), men, women and families.
Residents may be transients who are passing through Brockville, those
residents of Brockville and surrounding area who are made homeless by
natural calamity, residents who cannot afford a room or apartment or who
have been evicted and have not yet found alternative accommodation,
recently paroled individuals, referrals from Canada Mental Health or other

social agencies

Eacility
The proposed site is the Water Pollution Control administration building on

highway #2, located in front of the current water treatment plant

Contribution Sought from The City of Brockville

-The City of Brockville would provide the use of the building, rent free for a
period of five years. At the end of five years an equitable rent would be

negotiated by both parties.
= The City of Brockville would make any necessary repairs as demanded to

comply with Fire Department, building bylaw, or hydro requirements.
= The City of Brockville would continue to mow the lawns and remove the

snow as needed.

Contribution of Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc,

= Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. would make any needed
interior alterations( subject to approval by the City) and furnish the
building at their own expense. Note attached estimate by Tress
Construction

Page 47 0149,

- Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc would pay any necessary
staffing costs and recruit volunteers to assist in the operation of the
shelter

- Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. would develop programs and
liaise with the various local social service agencies tomeet the needs
of the residents

- Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc would pay for all supplies and
equipment needed to operate the shelter

~ Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. would pay the costs for hydro
and water & sewage for the operation of the facility

Benefits
~The building is currently unoccupied and therefore of no benefit to the

City. By allowing Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc to occupy
the building as a shelter, a definite need is met and the requirement
for security and regular inspections is avoided

+ as Fresh Wind Community Residence Inc. would be assuming the
cost of heat, hydro and water a significant savings would be realized
by the City

~ by providing the homeless a place to stay, there will be fewer on the
street during the night resulting in fewer fights, public urination
charges, vandalism and perhaps lower policing costs

- there would be no need to pay for overnight stays in local hotels or to
pay the cost to transport these individuals to shelters in Ottawa or
Kingston

~ beds would be available for Canada Mental Health patients ( who
currently only have one bed for emergency occupancy)

Costs to the City
~_Itis likely that the fire department will require that a sprinkler system
be installed and /or smoke detectors on each floor
