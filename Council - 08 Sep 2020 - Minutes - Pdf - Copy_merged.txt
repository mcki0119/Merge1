Request for face mask by-law (multi-tenant buildings)
Bill Fraser, Boardwalk Condominium

Gail Blake, Tall Ships Landing Condominium

Lois Rosine, Tall Ships Landing Condominium

B. Fraser noted recent Public Health Order instituted by the Lanark, Leeds
and Grenville Health Unit, mandating the wearing of face masks in public
spaces in the region only pertains to public spaces and does not deal with
common areas contained within private buildings. He stated multi-tenant
buildings have high population density, with residents sharing many
common features such as mail services, elevators, hallways, lounge areas,
and doorknobs and other common “touch” surfaces. As a result, should a
Coronavirus outbreak establish in a multi-tenant building it could spread
into the community-at-large like wildfire. They are requesting that Council
implement a face mask by-law to include all common and/or public areas
within all condominium and apartment buildings in Brockville.

Moved by: Councillor Wren

THAT staff be directed to report back to the September 22nd, 2020 Council
meeting with recommendations on a temporary mandatory face mask by-
law that includes face mask use in within public or common indoor areas of
multi-residential apartment and condominium buildings and it include all
provisions currently incorporated into the order issued by the Lanark,
Leeds and Grenville Health Unit.
