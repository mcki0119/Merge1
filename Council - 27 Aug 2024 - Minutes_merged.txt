Mayor Wren welcomed members back to Chambers following a reduced summer
meeting schedule and noted regrets from Councillors Earle and Lavergne,

His Worship acknowledged the passing of former City Police Officer Ed Clary who
served in the role for 31 years and former City Police Chief Barry King who served
from 1995-2007. Mayor Wren also acknowledged the passing of Mr. Peter Lewis,
former Mayor of the City of Brockville from 1981 to 1982, noting Mr. Lewis was
third generation Mayor as both his grandfather and father also held that role.

Mayor Wren said the City will be lowering the flags at Tunnel Bay during the week
of September Sth in honour of these three men and their service to the City.

His Worship congratulated Sheena Earl, City Clerk on obtaining an Executive
Diploma in Municipal Management from the Association of Municipalities of
Ontario.

Mayor Wren announced he recently attended the Association of Municipalities of
Ontario Conference held in Ottawa where he participated in collaborative learning
and delegations. He said he met with the Ontario Medical Association on behalf of
the City to discuss local challenges regarding access to local primary care

physicians and the challenges of rural physician recruitment. Mayor Wren referred
to work being done in this regard with the St Lawrence Corridor Economic

Development Commission as all local Mayors share similar concerns. His Worship

said he also met with the Honourable Kinga Surma, Minister of Infrastructure to
discuss the city's infrastructure needs, in particular, the need to replace the City’s
main pumping station and the work completed to date on the City's Multi-Use
Recreational Facility. He noted a recently announced provincial funding stream for
recreational facilities at a maximum of $10 million per municipality and said staff
are reviewing the criteria and looking at ways to maximize the funding
opportunity.

With respect to initiatives to support the homeless community, Mayor Wren
announced that during a Special Joint Services Committee held in August, there
was unanimous support to establish a 25-unit cabin neighbourhood on the grounds
of the former water pollution control administration building and surrounding
grounds. He noted the buildings will be ready by November or December and the
John Howard Society will be responsible for managing the site and supporting the
residents. Mayor Wren thanked the provincial government for thelr program.
funding and continued support from MPP Steve Clark and acknowledged Council's
previous decision to allow for this to proceed. His Worship noted the City is also
working with the Brockville Housing Partnership to help salve some of the
challenges they are facing.

Mayor Wren bid farewell to the City's summer students and thanked them for their
work. He reminded residents to take note of washroom operating schedules and
directed the public to the City's website for more information.

His Worship noted he toured the new Swift Waters Elementary School last week
which will also be the home of Campus Kids childcare centre and Early On, both of
which were previously located in Commonwealth Public School. He said the school
board will hold a public opening in October. He reminded drivers to take great care
as students and buses make their way back to school.

With respect to the September meeting schedule, Mayor Wren noted the Planning
and Development Committee meeting scheduled for September 3rd has been
cancelled due to a lack of agenda items and therefore the Council meeting of
September 10th will also be cancelled. He said the General Committee will meet
on September 17th at 4:30 p.m. and Council will meet on September 24th. The
regular meeting schedule is expected to resume in October.
