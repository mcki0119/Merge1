Emergency Cooling Centre
Councillor L. Bursey

Moved by: Councillor Bursey

Whereas June 2020 brought about unseasonably warm temperatures and
warmer weather is anticipated this season; and

Whereas, due to COVID 19 restrictions current public facilities such as the
Brockville Public Library, the Centennial Youth Arena, and Brockville
Memorial Centre are not available for public use at this time; and

Whereas, due to COVID 19 and the changing face of retail, public spaces
like mall food court cafeterias are also not readily accessible at that time;
and

Whereas many citizens can not readily access central air conditioning at
their place of residence, due to no shortage of reasons including home
energy costs, precarious under housing, or any variety of additional
reasons; and

Whereas other neighbouring urban centre municipalities have either
discussed implementing emergency protocols for public cooling centres, or
have already done so; and

Whereas, for many this is their first time not having access to the

Brockville direct staff to investigate possible options for public cooling
centres that can be accessed by the public during extreme heat; and

‘That staff report back to council with parameters for potential costs,
locations, conditions and hours of operation, and how to achieve this public
accommodation with respect current public health social distancing
directives and protocols, with the direct intention of crafting a Brockville
emergency cooling centre policy for immediate implementation where
deemed necessary.
