2.2 — Victoria Building Window Retrofit

Projec

Project Description:

Phase 6 of City Hall Window Retrofit program to improve both energy efficiency and
esthetic of all City Hall Windows.

Project Rationale:

The project originated from and Energy Audit of City Hall that recommended
retrofitting the windows would increase energy efficiency and at the same time save
money spent on heating and cooling. As the Ontario Heritage Trust has restrictions on
changes to City Hall due to their funding of the restoration of the Clock Tower, it was
not possible to replace the windows with new but to restore the original windows.

10.1 — Computer Replacement Program

& Rationale

Proj ription:

The intent of the computer replacement program is to provide for the replacement
and upgrade of computer related hardware and software on a four year rotational
basis.

Project Rationale:

The replacement program is based on a four (4) year lifecycle. There are two (2)
categories of users: Primary & Secondary. Primary users are those staff who use
their computer systems between eight (8) and twenty-four (24) hours per day. All
other users are classified as secondary. Secondary users receive rebuilt
equipment from end of cycle computers which are left over from primary users.
MIS staff rebuilds the equipment and distributes it accordingly. This is performed
on an as needed basis and helps to lower the total cost of ownership associated
with Information Technology within the corporation.

Rem ity’s in building WiFi

Remove aa aes the City’s in building WiFi systems. The in building WiFi system

provides wireless connectivity to staff and guests in the majority of our City offices. The

current system is approaching the seven year mark and is due to be replaced. Current
technology standards such as A/C are not available on the current equipment. Further, 46,000
prices for wireless equipment have come down significantly and due to this we would

be able to deploy more access points and deliver broader coverage at higher rates of

speed.

Document Management m — Ph:

Purchase and deploy a corporate document management system. Project funding

Phase 2. The purpose of this project is to purchase and deploy a document

management system. The system is to provide a central repository for all City

documents in digital form. The funding of this project would take a phased funding 50,000
approach that would ask for $50,000 in 2017 and $50,000 in 2018. Phase 1 funding of

$50,000 was approved during the 2017 budget process.

Trend Micro Antivirus Enhan

Ransomware is increasingly targeting servers. Attackers use known software

vulnerabilities to inject ransomware which in turn compromises files and applications

and is disruptive to City business. We already utilize the Trend Micro suite of products

on our server and endpoint (PC’s) machines. Deploying the Integrity Monitoring 28,000
product will help us in detecting and stopping malicious programs should they gain

access to our systems before they can do damage. Further, we would like to extend

the Antivirus protection we currently have to our fleet of mobile devices to ensure they

have the same protection as other equipment utilized to conduct City business.

Firewall Replacement - Police

To replace a seven year old firewall appliance at the Brockville Police Service. The

current firewall at Police headquarters and the corresponding unit at the Court house

are well beyond their service lives. Since the installation of these units, there have

been significant advances in terms of security and the availability of units that provide 25,000
better services at a lower cost. It is imperative that the BPS keep up to date to ensure

‘the protection of critical and confidential information.

Vadim Financial System Upgrade

Vadim has changed their process for major software updates. Previously they would

plan a major upgrade every 2 to 4 years, but this can be expensive if municipalities

have to pay it out all at once. What Vadim is doing now is spreading the major upgrade 29,999
over a few years. This is how the program will work: the upgrades will be module by

module. Once a module is released, a municipality has 18 months to use the old

version before it is no longer supported. These upgrades are mandatory.

rity Appliance Intrusion Detection

To purchase and deploy a network intrusion detection system to allow for more rapid
identification and removal of malicious software within the corporate network. Intrusion
Detection Systems automatically and accurately identify hidden infections in real time
on live traffic. This tool will provide us with the means to identify, contain and nullify
threats that exist on our network before they have a chance to spread. We currently
employ standard practices of having firewalls and antivirus protection in place. The
Intrusion Detection System is the third point in our triad of secutity services and will
help us in ensuring confidentiality, Integrity, and availability of our data.

It is our intent to deploy this product to provide countermeasures against Crypto
Ransomware and other related threats. This product is one tool in the defense against
the kind cyber threat that held the University of Calgary's data hostage.

IT Man: rvic ntré

Through the RFP process, engage and retain managed services from a qualified IT
service company to monitor the City’s critical infrastructure 24/7/365. The IT
infrastructure of the City of Brockville is constantly changing and becoming more
complex as it evolves. The addition of systems such as GIS, the expansion of
software related support services, and criticality of data retention and backups, have
outpaced ITS staff's ability to adequately monitor and provide service for our critical
systems. The approach until now has been one of break fix which has higher cost
implications on a per incident basis. 20,000
The managed service would monitor our critical systems 24/7/365 and alert us during
standard or non-standard business hours to situations that arise so they can be
addressed before they become problematic. Operations such as the Brockville Fire
Department, Water, and Waste Water, all depend on systems being available at all
times. Taking a more proactive contracted approach would allow is to more readily
regulate the costs of outside contractors. The procurement of this service would
allow is to discontinue the use of current monitoring software that we have in place
thus, eliminating a support contract cost of over $4,000.00 annually.
