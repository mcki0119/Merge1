Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, March 26, 2024

His Worship offered condolences to the family of Mr. Joe Hudson, tremendous
contributor and businessman. He spoke of the positive impact Mr. Hudson and
Burnbrae Farms has had on the community and offered his sympathy and support
to the Hudson family on behalf of City Council.

Mayor Wren congratulated recent inductees into the Music and Performing Arts
Hall of Fame presented at the Brockville Arts Centre last week and thanked
organizers, noting more than 100 inductees have been recognized since the
inception of the Hall of Fame.

Mayor Wren said the Joint Services Committee of Leeds and Grenville held a
special meeting recently to consider recommendations regarding a partnership
with Flourish, a real-estate development branch of supportive housing specialist
Indwell. Mayor Wren noted all 13 mayors unanimously voted in favour to support
this initiative which will potentially bring 150 supportive housing units and wrap
around support services with a view to end homelessness in the community. He
noted critical funding needs and referred to the Provincial Budget delivered this
evening and his hope that it contains some funding for supportive housing
initiatives. Mayor Wren indicated of the anticipated total project cost of $55,
million, $6 to $7 million will be required as a local contribution along with an
additional $3 million in community donations, noting an annual provincial
healthcare operating cost of $5 million. His Worship said the City will not solve the
issue of homelessness on its own and thanked other local municipalities for their
support saying he remains hopeful that provincial and federal funding will
materialize.

With respect to the Brockville Railway Tunnel, Mayor Wren said unfortunately the
difficulties associated with the lighting system are greater than expected and
noted staff have been in contact with a senior official at Signify, the lighting
provider. He said the issues will take time to resolve and noted that these
Unforeseen challenges do not reflect the work of staff to maintain the asset and
thanked the community for their continued patience.
