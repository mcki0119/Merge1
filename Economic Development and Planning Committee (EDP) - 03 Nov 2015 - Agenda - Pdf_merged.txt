REPORT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING COMMITTEE — 03 NOVEMBER,
2015

2015-107-11
CITY RESPONSE TO ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. M, PASCOE MERKLEY
NEW 40 METRE MONOPOLE COMMUNICATIONS TOWER —_DIR. OF PLANNING
2399 PARKEDALE AVENUE, BROCKVILLE J. FAURSCHOU

PLANNER I

RECOMMENDED

1. THAT Industry Canada be notified that the Corporation of the City of Brockville has no
‘objection to the location of a proposed 40 metre communication tower to be
constructed at 2399 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville:

PURPOSE

To provide comment to Rogers Communications inc. as per Industry Canada’s Public
Default Consultation Process CPC 2-0-03, Issue 5, entitled "Radiocommunications and
Broadcasting Antenna Systems”.

BACKGROUND

Radiocommunication is a field exclusively within the legislative competence of the federal
government. Therefore, matters that affect the establishment of federally authorized radio
stations are governed by the Radiocommunication Act and the policies thereunder. The
‘Municipality does not have the authority to prohibit the establishment of such facilties, if
approved by the federal government.

Industry Canada is the federal body which has approval authority and jurisdiction over the
installation and operation of radio communication systems. The approval of site-specific
radio and telecommunication facilties is governed by the Client Procedures Circular (CPC
2-0-03, Issue 5, entitled “Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Antenna Systems")

CPC 2.0.03, Issue 5, outlines the process that must be followed by proponents seeking to
install or modify antenna systems. The broad elements of the process are as follows:

1. Investigating sharing or using existing infrastructure before proposing new antenna-
‘supporting structures.

2. Contacting the land-use authority (LUA) to determine local requirements regarding
antenna systems,

3. Undertaking public notification and addressing relevant concems, whether by
following local LUA requirements or Industry Canada's default process, as is

Page 23 of 158

2018-107-11 Report to City Council Page 20f 10
City Response To Rogers Communications

New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2399 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville

required and appropriate.
4. Satisfying Industry Canada’s general and technical requirements.
5. Completing the construction,

Itis Industry Canada's expectation that steps (2) to (4) will normally be completed within
120 days.
Inthe event that the Municipality opposes a radio communication facility, the Municipality

‘may provide Industry Canada with a report outlining their reasons for objection within 60
days of receiving official notice of the intent to establish such a structure.

‘As per CPC 2.0-03, Issue 5, Clause 4.2, Rogers Communications Inc. undertook Initial
‘contact and pre-consultation with the City of Brockville and a discussion surrounding the
‘proposed installation took place with 26 June 2015,

(On 17 September 2016, the City of Brockville received a “Site Selection Report-Wireless
Communications Installation, Pt 12, Con 1, Elizabethtown, Brockville, Ontario, Rogers Site
C4705 — Parkedale Avenue & Windsor Drive’. A copy of the Public Notification Package
thas been attached as Schedule “A” to this Report.

‘On Monday, 21 September 2015, the “Site Selection Report” was circulated to Council,
‘Senior Management Team and the MIS Supervisor for comment. Results of this process.
located elsewhere in this report. Results of the circulation are proved elsewhere in this
report.

Official Plan and Zoning and information:

Official Plan Designation: "Mixed-Use and Commercial Area” (see OP Policy 4.5) with
‘Mixed-Use Node Considerations (see O.P. Section 3.2.21)

Zoning: “MC-1-Mixed Use Corridor, Special Exception Zone
Site Characteristics:

2399 Parkedale Avenue is currently occupied by a variety of commercial uses under the
‘umbrella of the 1000 Islands Mall

‘Various images of the site and surrounding area are included within Schedule “A” to this
report.

City Response To Rogers Communications

New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2399 Parkedale Avenve, Brockville

‘Surrounding Land Uses:

North: The lands to the north, across Parkedale Avenue, are zoned C2-General
‘Commercial Zone and are occupied by a variety of commercial uses and one
vacant commercial lot

N-East The lands to the north-east are zoned C2-General Commercial Zone and is
‘occupied by a Tim Hortons restaurant.

N-West:The lands to the north-west, across the intersection of Parkedale Avenue and
Windsor Drive are zoned RE-Multiple Residential Zone, to the east, and are
‘occupied by block of three (3) low rise apartment buildings.

East: The land to the east is zoned E1-Business Park Zone and is occupied by an
industrial use.

South: The land parallel to, and immediately south, i the Highway 401 corridor. South of
the corridor the lands zoned MC-Mixed Use Corridor Zone to the west, and R6-
Muttiple Residential Zone, to the east, and are occupied by the Brockville
‘Shopping Centre and the Balmoral Apariments, respectively

West: The lands to the west are zoned C2-General Commercial Zone and C2-General
Commercial, Special Exception Zone, and are occupied by a variely of
‘commercial uses and a gas bar.

ANALYSIS:

‘The City of Brockville does not have a protocol through which to address applications for
radiocommunications and broadcasting antenna systems. Accordingly, assessment of
‘such applications must follow the protocols set out by Industry Canada under CPC-2-0-03,
Issue 5. Rogers Communications Inc. is responsible to ensure that the Industry Canada
Protocols are followed and submitted with their application for approval to Industry Canada,

Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) Considerations:

Provincial policies are not applicable to Federal regulations pertaining to matters under the
Radiocommunication Act, although the PPS does include the term “Infrastructure® and
various references to infrastructure within the Provincial Policies.

Accordingly, it is worth examining the Provincial policies in ight of forming a municipal
position on the current application for a 40 metre monopole.

Page 25 of 158

12018-10711 Report to City Council Page 4of 10
‘Cy Response To Rogers Communications

New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2399 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville

‘An updated Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) issued under section 3 of the Planning Act
came into effect April 30, 2014. The PPS provides policy direction on matters of Provincial
interest related to land use planning and development. Section 3 of the Planning Act
further directs that Council decisions affecting planning matters “shall be consistent with”
the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial interest.
Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under consideration, and
thus, only those relevant portions will be referenced below.

‘The PPS defines “infrastructure” as follows:

‘Intrastructure: means physical structures (facilities and corridors) that form the
foundation for development. Infrastructure includes: sewage and water systems,
septage treatment systems, stormwater management systems, waste
‘management systems, electricity generation facilities, electricity transmission and
distribution systems, communications/telecommunications, transit _and
transportation corridors and facilites, ol and gas pipelines and associated
facies.”

Part 1.0 Building Strong Communities and Part 3.0 Protecting Public Health and Safety,
contain a wide range of policies which recognize the need forall aspects of growth but also
focus on growth without adverse effects on the existing and future development within the
settlement area

Section 1.7-Long Term Economic Prosperity includes the following statement under
‘Subsection 1.7.1 Long-term economic prosperity:

°K) encouraging efficient and coordinated + communications _and
felecommunications infrastructure.

Part 4.0 Implementation and Interpretation, Subsection 4.11 recognizes the need to
integrate land use approvals under various legislation and policies as follows:

"4.11 In addition to land use approvals under the Planning Act, infrastructure may
also require approval under other legislation and regulations. An environmental
‘assessment process may be applied to new infrastructure and modifications to
‘existing infrastructure under applicable legislation.

There may be circumstances where land use approvals under the Planning Act
‘may be integrated with approvals under other legislation, for example, integrating

Page 26 of 158

2018-107-11 Report to City Council Page Sof 10
‘Cy Response To Rogers Communications

New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

12390 Parkedale Avenue, Brockvile

the planning processes and approvals under the Environmental Assessment Act
‘and the Planning Act, provided the intent and requirements of both Acts are met.”

In summary, the PPS supports the need and installation of communications and
telecommunications infrastructure but also brings forward the need to ensure that such
facilities are not constructed to the detriment of a strong and healthy community.

‘As such, the City of Brockville has a responsibilty to review applications for new
infrastructure and to ensure that adverse effects are prevented or, where this is not viable,
then such adverse effects should be mitigated within the settlement areas.

Oficial Plan Considerations:
2309 Parkedale Avenue is currently designated as “Mixed-Use and Commercial Area”

(see OP Policy 4.5) with “Mixed-Use Node" Considerations (see O.P. Section 3.2.2.1.)
Under the Official Pian for the City of Brockvil

Policies under the Section 4.5 “Mixed-Use and Commercial Area” address uses and design
of new structures but do not address telecommunications towers.

‘Similarly, Policies under the Section 3.2.2.1 are geared to ensure the provision of an
effective means of establishing a City Structure, upon which land use designations are
based.

‘The Official Plan does not contain policies which directly address the siting of
radiocommunications and broadcasting antenna systems. However, Part 5, Section 5.5-
Usiities and Telecommunications, Sub-section 6. and 11. state the following:

"6.5 Utilities and Telecommunications
It shall be the policy of the City that:

6. The City shall promote and encourage the shared and multiple use of
felecommunications towers and corridors for utility uses. Additionally, the City shall
‘support the use of corridors for transportation and trail uses.

11. The City shall ensure that all large, above-ground utlity infrastructure,
‘including communications towers, is located and designed to be compatible with
its surroundings and consistent with the urban design policies of this Plan. Such
infrastructure 1s discouraged within Neighbourhood Areas and Neighbourhood

2018-107-11 Report to Cty Council Page 6 of 10
City Response To Rogers Communications

New 49 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2399 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville.

Development Areas; however, service providers shall consult and work with the
City to identify suitable areas to locate above ground utiity infrastructure.”

The proposed 40 metre monotower is not located within either a “Neighbourhood Area” or
2 ‘Neighbourhood Development Area” and is therefore consistent withthe policies under
section 5.5 in regard to preferred siting

In parallel to the PPS, the Official Plan supports the need and installation of
communications and telecommunications infrastructure but also brings forward the need to

ensure that such facilities are constructed to ensure integration into the surrounding
neighbourhood character and livability.

Zoning By-law Considerations:

2399 Parkedale Avenue is currently zoned as MC-1-Mixed Use Corridor, Special Exception
Zone" under City of Brockville Zoning By-1a 040-2015, as amended, which reads as follows:

"6.3.2.1 MC-A Zone (1000 Islands Mall, 2299 Parkedale Avenue)
Notwithstanding any other provision ofthis By-law, parking space sizes for 90
degree parking spaces shale 27 metres by 85 metres wih a6.0 metre access
aisle.

The minimum requied numberof parking spaces shallbe 4.5 spaces por 100.00
mf of gross leasable area.”

2309 Parkedale Avenues a commercial shopping mall operating under the banner of 1000

Islands Mall.

City of Brockville Zoning Bylaw 050-2014, as amended, Part3, 351 e) reads a8 folows:

"3.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS:
3.51 YARD, SETBACK AND HEIGHT ENCROACHMENTS PERMITTED

‘Notwithstanding any height provisions contained in this By-law, nothing in the
By-law shall apply to prevent the erection or use of:

clock tower, a chimney, a radio or television tower, or an antenna or satelite
dish; ..”

Despite the above, City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014, as amended, does not
specifically regulate radiocommunication and broadcasting antenna systems as such
facilities are exempt from municipal control

Public Consultation:

Under the CPC-2-0-03, Issue 5, as the City of Brockville does not have a Tower Protocol,
the applicant is required to comply with CPC-2-0-03, Issue 5, Section 4.2 Industry
Canada's Default Public Consultation Process.

‘Accordingly it the responsibilty of Rogers to ensure compliance with the CPC-2-0-03, Issue
5, Section 4.2 Industry Canada’s Default Public Consultation Process

Comments Received - intemal

On 21 September 2015, the "Site Selection Report” was circulated to Council, Senior
‘Management Team and the MIS Supervisor for comment with the following results:

1. C. Cosgrove, Director of Operations, 23 September 2015:
“The Operations Department has no comments with respect to this application.”
2. P. Raabe, Director of Environmental Services, 03 June 2015:

“The Environmental Services Department has no concems with the application for
construction of a communication monopole at the 1000 Islands Mall.”

3. B. Caskenette, CBCO, 21 September 2015:

fario Code Considerations:

‘A communication tower is exempt from the Building Code Act, 1992 m S.O. 1992,
Chapter 23, Div. ‘A’ Part 1, Section 1.3.1.1 Designated Structures. Accordingly, no
Building Permit is required. However, should any accessory structure exceeding 10
im’ be required on the site, a Building Permit shall be required.”

‘New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2399 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville

4, Randy Watson, MIS Supervisor, 09 October 2015:

“I have reviewed the documents and don't see any issues with this location.”

‘Consideration of Potential Issues:
4. Visual impact - Lighting:

Municipal experience with a previous comparable monopole facility in proximity with
residential uses resulted in the need for special design considerations for the
‘topmost lighting.

However, confirmation has been provided from Nav Canada that no lighting is
required for the proposed 40 m monopole installation at 2399 Parkedale Avenue,
Brockville. Accordingly lighting is not a concem for this project.

2, Integration Into Local Surroundings:

Given the nature of the location, being in a commercial area adjacent to the 401
corridor, no special integration measures are deemed to be required.

3. Impact On Mall Parking:

‘The MC-1 Zone requires that “The minimum required number of parking spaces
shall be 4.5 spaces per 100.00 m of gross leasable area.”

“The mall consists of 27,699.9 m* of gross leasable area witha minimum of 1267
parking spaces. Availabe information Kentiies a total of 1338 parking spaces on-
site.

Accordingly, the loss of two parking spaces to construction of the monopole, cabinet

and enclosure will not adversely affect the minimum required parking at 2399
Parkedale Avenue.

4. Alternate Site / Co-location Consideration:

‘The Site Selection Report package, Item 4. Examines the possibilty of co-location
and summarises the findings as follows:

“As no other suitable alternative structure was readily available, Rogers is
proposing construction of its own installation at @ height necessary to

Page 30 of 158

[New 40 Metre Monopole Communications Tower

2390 Parkedale Avenue, Brockville

deliver coverage objectives for our network for this area.”

‘Accordingly, Rogers appear to have considered co-location with the proposed site
being the resutt.

(Ontario Building Code Considerations:
‘A.communication tower is exempt from the Building Code Act, 1992m S.0. 1992, Chapter
23, Div. ‘A’ Part 1, Section 1.3.1.1 Designated Structures. Accordingly, no Building Permit
is required. However, should any accessory structure exceeding 10 m* be required on the
site, a Building Permit shall be required

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The Municipality does not have the authority o prohibit the establishment of such facilites,
if approved by the federal government.

‘The City of Brockville does not have direct policies or a protocol o address applications for
Radiocommunication and Broadcasting Antenna Systems. Accordingly, the application is
managed through the Industry Canada Default Public Consultation Process CPC-2-0-03,
Issue 5.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Allcosts associated with the complying with industry Canada's Public Default Consultation
Process and construction and maintenance of the proposed 40 m monopole are the
responsibilty of Rogers Communications Inc.

Based on informal feedback from MPAC, the proposed tower would increase the
‘assessment by $65,000 to $70,000. Applying the current commercial tax rate, this would
transiate into approximately $1,654 to $1,781 in additional municipal taxes payable.

CONCLUSION

Based on available information provided by Rogers Communications Inc. in the following
submission, ‘Site Selection Report Wireless Communications installation, Pt 12, Con 1,
Ezabethtown, Brockville, Ontario, Rogers Site C4705 ~ Parkedale Avenue & Windsor
Drive” it is appropriate to advise Industry Canada that forthe City of Brockville has. no
objection to the construction of a 40 m monopole at 2389 Parkedale Avenue.

41. Introduction,
Rogers Communications inc. “Rogers” strives to constantly improve coverage and network quality
to remain the leading wireless provider in Canada,

In the recent past, due to subscriber feedback and other data factors such as dropped calls or
Quality of calls, our Network Planning and Engineering departments have become aware of
‘coverage deficiencies in the north part of Brockville, west of Highway 401. A survey of this area
identified a proposed site that will achieve the necessary engineering coverage objectives for our
network

‘This Justification report intends to provide network, siting, and technical deta relevant to our
[Proposal in accordance to Industry Canada’s guidelines set out in CPC-2-0-03 Issue 5".

2. The Proposal
Rogers proposes to install a new wireless communications antenna installation on a privately
‘owned property at 2389 Parkedale Ave, Brockville, Ontario. This Information is also provided on
‘Appendix 1.

‘The property's legal description is: PT LT 12 CON 1 ELIZABETHTOWN, Brockville, Ontario.

‘The geographic coordinates forthe site are as follows: Lattude: (NAD 83) 44 36 04.40N &
Longitude: (NAD 83) 75 41 59.450


Page 35 of 158

3. Coverage Objectives
Designing @ wireless network is similar to putting together @ 3D jigsaw puzzle. Antenna installations
‘are required to be located within a small geographic area so thet they are able to provide the
‘service levels required to specific areas. The coverage objectives for the proposed installation are
the folowing:

‘© To provide enhance in-bullting coverage for the mal area and to address deficiencies in the
north part of Brockvile, west of Highway 401. This area currently runs a below-average level
of wireless service due to the distance from existing antenna installations and a lack of
network capacty from surrounding overloaded installations,

‘The proposed antenna instalation has been designed and sited to improve wireless services along
this coridor and the community i supports.

4, Existing Structures (Sharing)

Before proposing a new antenna installation, Industry Canada requires proponents to evaluate
‘existing structures located within the specific geographical area that may offer the required height
‘and structural integrity for site shering.

‘Aerial view shows our proposal (C3472) and other existing antenna installations: Red pins for
Rogers, and blue pins for Bell Mobilty.

‘The proposed installation is located at a comparable distance to surrounding sites within our
‘network, allowing Rogers to provide increased service and address gaps In coverage. The existing
‘sites belonging to other carriers have been disqualified due to height, location and overloading

Page 36 of 158

details. Site F1489, operated by Bell is 14 metres in height and therefore does not offer the
‘colocation capacity that Rogers requires. Site £0257, also operated by Bell is located In close
proximity to one of Rogers’ existing sites and therefore has been ruled out as an option as this
proximity would not assist in reaching our coverage objectives. Rogers’ site C3021 Is fully loaded
‘with technology and would also not address the in-bullding coverage Issues that we are seeking to
remedy with our new proposal. Site F183 is too far south to achieve the coverage objectives we
have identified and is also too located to close to an existing Rogers site. As no other suitable
‘atemative structure was readly available, Rogers is proposing the construction of its own
Installation at a height necessary to deliver the coverage objectives for our network for this area,

For further information regarding the requirements for infrastructure sharing please refer to Section
3 of the CPC-2-0-03 Issue 5 and CPC-2-0-17, Condltons of Licence for Mandatory Roaming and
‘Antenna Tower and Site Sharing Available

5. Site Selection
‘When determining the best location for the operation of a new antenna system, Rogers takes In
consideration local landscape as well as the precise technical requirements for integrating its
‘equipment into its existing network. A survey of the area identified a candidate at the 100 Islands
‘Mall propery. This property is curently a mult-use commercial and retail development. An antenna
system at this location would support the necessary engineering coverage objectives for our
network,

‘Our proposed installation wil take advantage ofthe technical considerations offered a thie property
‘Such as: proximity to roads for viable access for construction and maintenance, hydro connections,
et, thus reducing the need for further impact onthe area. See Appendix 4for the Site Survey. Our
proposed instalation wil not resut in any interference or impact to the current use ofthe property
‘and Rogers and the property owner have confirmed thet there wil be no Impact to the minimum
‘numberof parking spaces stipulated under existing ste plan requlrements.
6. Description of Proposed Antenna System

7. Industry Canada’s Regulatory Scope
Under The Radiocommunication Act, the Minister of Industy has sole jurisdiction over inter-
provincial and International communication facilities. Any decision to approve and licence the
location of Antenna Systems is made only by Industry Canada. in June 2014, Industry Canada
Issued an update to its Radiocommunication and Broadcasting Antenna Systems Client Procedures
Circular (CPC-2-0-03) which outines the process that must be folowed by Proponents seeking to
Install or modify Antenna Systems, effective July 15, 2014.

‘As a federal undertaking, tho provisions of the Ontario Planning Act and other municipal bylaws
‘and regulations do not apply to Antenna Systome such as our proposal, however Section 4.1 of the
CPC, states that the concerns and suggestions expressed by land-use authorities are Important
elements to be considered by proponents when installing or modifying antenna systems.

8. Public Consultation
Rogers will be providing an Information package to all property owners located within a radius of
420 metres (3 times tower height) from the base of the proposed structure. Copies of
Information package and any correspondence resulting from the Interaction between the
Rogers will be provided to the City of Brockvile's Planning Department as part of the municipal
‘consultation process,

Page 38 of 158

Industry Canada's rules for public consultation contain requirements for timely response to any
‘questions, comments or concems related to the proposed installation. Rogers will acknowledge
receipt of communications received within 14 days and will provide a formal response to the Land-
use Authority and those members of the public who communicated to Rogers, within 60 days. The
‘members of the public who communicated with Rogers will hen have 2tdays to review and reply to
Rogers,

‘A final report of consultation and request for concurrence will be sent to the City of Brockville and
Industry Canada in accordance to CPC-2-0-3's guidelines for concluding public consultation.

10. Conclusion

Retable wireless communication services are a key element of economic development across
Canada. It faciitates the growth of local economies by providing easy access to information, and
‘Connectivity for residents and business alike.

Rogers feels the proposal to locate this 40m monopole facility 212399 Perkedale Ave, Brockville,
Ontario, is needed to address the increasing demand for wireless communication service in the
‘community, and is designed to have minimal Impact on surrounding land uses.

Specifically, the proposed site location:

Is located outside residential designations and zoned lands, and outside waterfront and
‘environmental senstive designated lands;

‘Is vital and essential tothe operation ofthe wireless network to provide continuous, reliable
network coverage;

‘+ Will be installed and operate In accordance to the policies and guidelines provided by
Industry Canada; and

‘+ Will minimize the need for new installations inthe aree, as this installation would provide co-
location opportunities for other wireless services as needed;

Rogers values the good working relatonship I enjoys with the City of Brockville, and looks forward
to continue providing improved wireless volce and data service. We respectfuly request staffs
review this proposal, and that once the requirements for publ consultation have been completed,
fn information repoit to Council be Issued, In accordance to the Town's protocol and Industry
Canada's guidelines.

I you require any further information about this matter, please contact me at your earliest

2. THAT the following Brownfields Community Improvement Plan Programs be
offered until December 31, 2018:
‘+ Brownfiekis Remediation Tax Increment Equivalent Grant (TIEG);
‘+ Environmental Remediation Tax Cancellation Assistance Program
(BFTIP)

PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this report is to make recommendations respecting the impending
expiry, on December 31, 2015, of program offerings under the Downtown and
Brownfields Community improvement Plans,

BACKGROUND

In April 2004, Council adopted the Downtown CIP with the primary goal of promoting
‘and encouraging commercial revitalization in the downtown area and the ancillary goal
‘of promoting the construction and rehabiltation of residential development, and the
conversion of upper floor commercial buildings into residential space.

‘Since the inception of the Downtown CIP, the various programs and grants have been
reviewed for effectiveness, and where deemed appropriate, modified, expanded and in
‘some instances, eliminated.

A substantial re-evaluation of programs was completed in 2012, at which time the
following Downtown CIP programs were confimed:

‘+ Tax Increment Equivalent for Rehabilitation and Redevelopment (TIERR) Grant
+ Facade Improvement Grant (FIG) (funded in 2013 and 2015)

Page 49 of 158

‘and Brownfields Programs.

«Residential or Commercial Conversion/Rehabiltation (RCCR) Grant (funded in
2013 and 2015)

In recognition of constraints to redevelopment caused by environmental contamination,
the Brownfields CIP was adopted in 2007. Since 2012, the following Brownfields CIP
programs have been available:

‘© Brownfields Remediation Tax Increment Equivalent Grant (TIEG)
* Environmental Remediation Tax Cancellation Assistance (BFTIP)

‘Schedule “A” to this report illustrates the Community Improvement Project Area, and
Priority Areas under the Downtown and Brownfield CIP.

By Council resolution in 2012, all current CIP program offerings will expire on December
31, 2015. To continue to offer the programs, further extension by resolution of Council
is required.

ANALYSIS

‘The CIP Downtown and Brownfields programs have been effective in leveraging private
sector reinvestment and/or environmental clean-up in the geographic areas identified
‘as Priority Area” in Schedule “A” to this report

Table 1, as shown below, Table One shows that while the estimated cost of the CIP
programs to 2018 is $3.5 milion, the tax revenue gained from the increased
‘assessment is $4.5 millon. This leaves a net revenue to the City of approximately $1
milion by 2018. Eventually, as the programs are completed, the City will gain the entire
‘$4.5 milion in tax revenue that is estimated to 2018.

Table 1

Report 2016-108-11 Page3
Extension of CIP Downtown
and Brownfields Programs.

‘Schedule “B", attached hereto, provides a sample of pre and post development
projects undertaken under various CIP Programs.

‘The use of community improvement incentives is common in many Ontario
municipalities. For consideration, MMM Group has prepared the attached brief on
‘community improvement best practices (see Schedule “C"). Additionally, through the
BMA Study 2014 which has been attached as Schedule “D” to this report, it is clear
that there is significant use of community improvement programs.

‘Support remains high for extension of the programs. The DBIA, which has been a
valuable partner when marketing the CIP programs to downtown businesses and
‘owners, as has the Brockville and District Chamber of Commerce, have provided letters,
(of support for the continuation of the programs. The letters have been attached to this
report as Schedule “E” and Schedule “F”, respectively.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘Through the Community Strategic Plan, the Official Plan and the Downtown &
Waterfront & Urban Design Strategy, the City of Brockville is committed to taking a
leadership role to continue to promote a high quality of life in the downtown and
‘waterfront area to protect the sense of place, promote its way of life and ensure
‘economic vitality.

Policies in the Official Plan are supportive of the use of the financial tools under Section
28 of the Planning Act to stimulate community improvement, rehabiltation and
revitalization, provided that the City is satisfied that participation in community
improvement activities is within its financial capabilites.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Financial implications of the CIP programs are presented annually to Council during
budget deliberations along with requests for funding of the FIG and RCCR Grant
Programs which operate strictly on the basis of leveraging a minimum of 50% of the
funds required from the private sector (property owners or tenants) for improvements to
Priority Area 4 lands and buildings.

‘CONCLUSION

AS noted previously in Table 1, the CIP programs contribute significantly to increased
‘assessment and net revenue to the City. In addition, given that there is much to
accomplish with respect to advancing the City’s objectives to stimulate growth and
investment in the Downtown and Central Waterfront Area, it is recommended that the
‘current CIP Programs be offered for a further three (3) year period.

AX um crovr Memo

To: Maureen Pascoe Merkley Date: September 29, 2015
From: Chris Tyrrell and Bobby Gauthier Job No: NIA
Subject: Best Practices in Community
Improvement Plans,
Dear Maureen,

‘Thank you for contacting us in regards to community improvement plan best practices. This
brief meme outines some of our preliminary thoughts on the topics that will need to be
‘addressed as part of preparing or updating a Community Improvement Pian.

1. Types of Programs

In general, what we are finding is that municipalities are expanding the range of incentive
programs in their Community Improvement Pians. In the past, community improvement plans
‘often only consisted principally of fagade and signage improvement grants. Today, even small
‘municipalities are integrating developmentredevelopment incentives and enabling brownfield
incentives under the Municipal Act. There is a desire to have a broad range of incentive tools
tobe able to respond to issues over time in @ flexible manner, In all cases, there is of course a
link between the types of programs offered and the vision, goals and objectives that are set
out. Table 1 at the end of this memo illustrates some of the programs offered by selected
‘municipalities,

We also note that many municipalities integrate public realm improvements and other
‘municipally led initiatives in their CIPs. During the course of consulting the public on a CIP,
oftentimes the issues raised by the public relate to the public realm, such as sidewalks, the
need for public space, park/rail improvements, street furniture, etc. Accordingly, streetscape
plans and leadership initiatives are sometimes integrated into the CIP to complement the
Incentive programs, Indeed, Community Improvement Plans are increasingly being used as
‘comprehensive action plans for downtown and main street areas,

2. Implementation Budget

‘Budgeting for incentive programs varies greatly between municipalities. Although larger
‘municipalities generally have larger implementation budgets, some small municipalities do set
large budgets, based on the success and demand they have received in previous years,
‘Municipalities that implement development incentives often need to plan for larger
implementation budgets, as the size of brownfield tax relief and tax increment grants can be
well over $100,000. A few examples of CIP implementation budgets (for financial incentives)
are as follows:

‘= Town of Perth budgets about $25,000 per year;

‘Township of Edwardsburgh/Cardinal budgets about $20,000 per year,

‘+ Town of Caledon budgets $100,000 per year (unused amounts are carried forward into
2 pool); and

‘= Haldimand County budgets $100,000 per year (unused amounts are carried forward)

Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between population and the size of funding (this was
included in our 2013 OPP! Conference Presentation). As noted, larger municipalities spend
‘more on their CiPs, but many smaller municipalities have established large budgets for various
reasons,

CIP Incentives Budget

3. GrantiLoan Value

“The value of a grant or loan is generally proportional to the size ofthe implementation budget.
Itwouid not be desirable for one applicant to utlize the entirety of the budget. Itis a best
practice amongst municipalities to limit the amount of a grant to 50% of the project's eligible
Costs, of a maximum value, whichever is less. Perth caps grants at 33% ofthe project's
eligible costs. Under the Planning Act, the value of the grants or loans cannot exceed the
eligible costs.

Page 57 of 158

BSS wncnovr Pages

Of course, a substantial grant value is required to be a significant incentive and to promote
private investment. A typical fagade grant, for example, isin the order of $3,000 to as much as
‘$15,000 or higher. The amount ofthe grant should be related to the type of program. For
example, a signage grant is usually lower, from around $1,500 to $5,000.

‘Many municipalities opt not to include loan programs in their CIP, as there are high
‘administrative costs, However, there are benefits to loans: they can yield very large
investments. In Amprior, we developed an “interest rebate" program, which provides a grant
‘equal to the amount of interest paid on a commercial loan, This enables the municipality to
‘encourage applicants to obtain a loan without bearing the administrative costs,

4, Success

Municipalities have had different levels of success with their CIPs. In our view, what is
‘common amongst many “successful” CIPs is:

1. Having urban design criteria/guidelines to establish standards for improvement projects;

2. Having an on-going marketing program to educate people about the programs,
including a website;

3. Assigning a staff member to proactively market the CIP's programs and meet with
potential applicants day-to-day;

44, Reporting on the success of the Plan, including case studies through annual reports
‘and newsletters;

5. Incorporating a monitoring and evaiuation program to monitor the performance of the
programs and make adjustments as necessary (this usually includes directon to have
‘an annual report to Council); and

6. Having a flexible implementation budget and flexible range of programs.

Many municipalities measure success in the form of the ratio of public dollars granted to
private dollars leveraged. If grants are capped at 50% of the cost of the project, a minimum
raio of 1:1 is to be expected (ie., for every $1 in public grants will yield at least $1 in private
investment). However. in practice, a ratio of 1:4 is most common (every $1 in public grants
yields $4 in private investment),

Anecdotally, we note that Edwardsburgh/Cardinal and Perth have exhausted their funding on
‘an annual basis. Haldimand County has been very successful, providing about $800,000 in
{grants to yield $4 millon in private investment. Other municipalities have had lower uptake.

5. Application Process

We note there is variation in the incentive application process administered by municipaites.
Perth has had great success in an intake window process, in which applications are only

0 Goran Vay Dre Waa Thal, ON LAT ONT [EEE TT00 [#005 ETRE | wove

Page 58 of 158
ANS sam crour Poges

‘accepted during limited periods in the year, and reviewed together. Most municipalities
implement a fst-come, first-served process. Note that should an intake process be used,
there is a need to determine how applications would be prioritized in the event that the
approved grants exceed the budget.

6 Conclusions:

‘As outined in this memo, there are many considerations that should be made during the
process of preparing and implementing a CIP. Should you require additional information,
please do not hesitate to contact us. We would be pleased to assist you further in your project.

Brownfield Redevelopment

‘A “Brownfield site” is considered to be a property with or without buildings or structures, having 2
history of elther Industral or commercial uses and which, as a result of these uses, has become
‘environmentally contaminated under circumstances where there is no reasonable prospect that the
‘remediation of such contamination wil be accomplished solely by the private sector. Brownfields are
viewed by many as opportunites for revitalizing urban communities. Some of the advantages of
Brownfield Redevelopment include:

‘+ Revitalization of the downtown core and surrounding neighbourhoods

+ More effective use of exiting municipal infrastructure
1+ Reduction in pressure for suburban expansion

‘+ Clean-up of environmentally contaminated sites

+ Increased tax revenue

+ Create obs

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

The Planning Report prepared by FoTenn Consultants provides rationale and justification
for the requested zoning amendments and staff generally concurs with the report's
‘comments and conclusions. The following represents additional analysis and commentary
Which support the recommendation in this report.

Provincial Policy Considerations:

‘The Provincial Policy Statement 2014 (PPS) issued under Section 3 of the Planning Act
provides policy direction on matters of Provincial interest related to land use planning and
development. Section 3 of the Planning Act further directs that Council decisions affecting
planning matters “shall be consistent with” the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS contains various policies. Those relevant to the subject application are
found in Section 1.0 Building Strong Healthy Communities. Within this Section are
statements on managing and directing land use to achieve efficient development and land
use pattems. More specifically, Subsection 1.1.1 speaks to healthy, liveable and safe
‘communities which are to be sustained by promoting efficient development, by
‘accommodating a mix of land uses to meet long-term needs, promoting cost-effective
development standards to minimize land consumption and servicing costs, and improving
accessibility for persons with disabilities and the elderly, among other things.

Section 1.2.6 deals with Land Use Compatibility and states that “Major facilities and
‘sensitive land uses should be planned to ensure they are appropriately designed, buffered
‘and/or separated from each other to prevent or mitigate adverse effects from odour, noise
land other contaminants, minimize risk to public health and safety, and to ensure the long-

‘a) providing for an appropriate mix and range of employment and institutional uses
to meet long-term needs;

) providing opportunities for a diversified economic base, including maintaining a
range and choice of suitable sites for employment uses which support a wide
range of economic activities and ancilary uses, and take into account the needs
Of existing and future businesses;

¢) encouraging compact, mixed-use development that incorporates compatible
‘employment uses to support liveable and resilient communities; and

) ensuring the necessary infrastructure is provided to support current and
projected needs.

| promote economic

Section 1.6.5 states that “Public Service facilities should be co-located in community hubs,
where appropriate, to promote cost-effectiveness and facltate service integrations, access
to transit and active transportation.”

‘Section 1.7 speaks to “Long-Term Economic Prosperity” and states that it should be
‘supported by the availability and use of land, resources, infrastructure, electricity
‘generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, and public service facilities.

Section 3.2.2 speaks to properties that may have contaminant issues. These issues must
bbe addressed and remediated as necessary prior to any activity occurring and such that
there will be no adverse effects.

Brockville General Hospital has been purchasing surrounding land over time in order to
provide a more cost effective development pattem and to minimize land consumption and

servicing costs. The proposed expansion is to occur within an established, municipally
serviced and transit-serviced neighbourhood. The proposed expansion will also help
promote active-transportation by providing adequate facilities for such.

In addition, the hospital has acquired lands including a small light industrial property, that
abut the CNR Main line. BGH has undertaken the required noise study and will be
‘engaging shortly in the required remediation of the industrial land to ensure compliance and
safety to the public. It can therefore be stated that the proposed expansion is consistent
with the above-stated goals, objectives and policies of the PPS 2014,

Official Plan Considerations.
‘The Official Plan provides guidance on how to manage future growth, development, and

change within the City of Brockville. The subject properties are designated under Schedule
1- City Structure, of the Official Plan, as “Institutional Area”.

‘The goal of the Official Plan is to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and amenities,
and is well planned,

‘Section 2.3 outtines strategic planning themes which include “A Sustainable, Healthy, and
Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, "A High Quality of City Services and
‘Amenities’, and “A Well-Planned Responsive City’. Specifically, “A Sustainable, Healthy,
‘and Vital City’ outlines, among others, that the City is to conserve and enhance the natural
environment while promoting @ healthy and safe community and promote a flexible and
‘adaptive economic environment that encourages investment and a broad range of
‘employment opportunities. This section also directs the City to protect the vitality and
‘growth of the employment sector by revitalizing the Downtown and Central Waterfront Area
‘8s well as promoting the development of education and skill enhancement systems and
facilities.

‘The proposed hospital expansion assists in reinforcing the strong sense of community by
providing a public service and promoting healthy and active living. The proposed
‘expansion is also expected to create operational efficiencies, expanded patient bed
availabilty and brings many services that are dispersed around the City under one roof.

‘Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. Through Policy 3.2.3 which
describes the City’s Urban Area, It is noted that the City should support opportunities for
infil, redevelopment and intensification through a mix and range of uses appropriate within
the community context.

Section 3.5.2 speaks to “Community Facilities" and that the City is to provide adequate

Page 89 of 158
auistonss Pages

wnat:
eoteane
Prono:

‘community services and facilities to meet the needs of the City's existing and future
residents. The City shall also encourage the provision of community-serving health care
facilities, which shall be directed to the Downtown and Central Waterfront Are, Mixed Use
‘and Commercial Nodes and Institutional Areas.

‘Section 3.7.2 deals with “Human-Made Hazards” and what steps the City will take 2
encourage remediating the sites to suit a new use. This section continues by encouragi
tho donficaton and ean-ap of contaminated sites. As slated previously, he hospital has
‘acquired small ight industrial property and will be undertaking the required remediation to
ensure compliance and safety to the public. In addition, the proximity to the CNR Mainline
has triggered the need for a noise study to be completed. This study has addressed the
rneed for specific window ratings, building construction ratings and central air conditioners
to be imposed on the new expansion.

Section 4.8 addresses institutional Areas including permitted uses and land use and built
form polices. Subsection 4.8.3 states that Institutional Area. development shall be
consistent with the City's Downtown and Central Waterfront Guidelines, be evaluated on
the compatiilty with surounding uses and availablity of physical services, access to
parking must be available, the site must be accessible to alll individuals and must provide a
{gradual transition in terms of bulding profile based on adjacent buildings.

‘The proposed hospital addition will provide a suitable scale and massing in relation to the
existing buit form (BCI, Commonwealth Public School and former Abbott Laboratories).
The proposal is maintaining existing heights and providing varying setback from Pearl
Street in order to break up the street wall and reduce the perceived mass of the structure
from the street. New landscaping is proposed to enhance the separation between the
proposed addition and adjacent uses. A Transportation Impact Study was prepared which
assessed the impacts of the hospital expansion.

In general, there does not appear to be any conflicts with the Official Plan policies with
respect to a project of this nature in this location. In fact, it would advance many of the
City’s goals and objectives as described herein.

Zoning By-law Considerations:

‘The subject property is currently zoned as 1 - General Institutional Zone, in part, R3 —
General Residential Zone, in part, and E3-1 Restricted Employment Special Exception
Zone, in part. Accordingly, an application has been made for an amendment to Zoning By-
law 050-2014 to rezone the subject lands to It ~ General Intutional Special Exception
Zone.

‘The application proposes to rezone multiple properties assembled by BGH with multiple
zones associated with the lands. This proposed rezoning would also include the rezoning
of the Charles Street road allowance to the 1 ~ General Institutional Special Exception
Zone.

Respecting the proposed stop-up and close of Charles Street, there have been no
substantial concems raised; however, one concem was received from the owner of a
neighbouring property, 135 Ormond Street. 135 Ormond Street currently has an access
ramp which allows for deliveries to be made to the second floor as well as a means of
‘egress from the building. Hospital Officials and City Staff have had discussion with the
Owner of 135 Ormond Street regarding the proposed street closure. These discussions
remain on-going and relate to providing a maintenance easement for 135 Ormond Street
along the Charles Street road allowance among other things.

In addition, the City would like to maintain ownership of the servicing within the road
allowance as there are multiple water mains, a sewer main and a storm sewer that lay
beneath the paved surface. The hospital is aware of this and retaining the proper
easements for these services will be a condition to the transfer the street

Given that the development would not meet all pre-existing zone provisions established for
lands which are zoned |1 - General Institutional Zone, there would be site spectic
elements required to address the non-standard items. Accordingly it would be necessary
for Council to concur with the overall rezoning as well as the non-standard elements which
‘would be implemented on a site-specific basis through the creation of a new special
exception zone.

‘The following is a discussion of the elements that need to be addressed as “special
exceptions” for the proposed hospital redevelopment:

1) Front Yard Setback (Ormond Street)

Section 3.52 of Zoning By-law 050-2014 outlines that where a street has a
right-of-way width of less than 20.0 metres, then notwithstanding the yard
requirements established in this By-law for any zone, no building or structure
shall be erected closer than a distance equal fo the sum of 10.0 metres, and
the required setback (front yard) in that zone from the original centre line of
the improved public street right-of-way,

Based on this requirement, the hospital would require a setback from the
street centreline on Ormond Street of 16.0 metres. Based on an existing
situation, the setback is at 10.9 metres; however, the setback from the

Page 91 of 158
aus t0041 Page 10

property line is 4.77 metres, not the 6.0 metres required. Therefore, the front
yard setback will be recognized through the special exception zone.

i) Setback from Peat Street

Based on a review of the proposed plan and due to alterations that are being
‘anticipated for the main floor of the existing hospital, a new covered walkway
for means of egress is being proposed. This walkway will encroach into the
required setbacks from Pearl Street and will be addressed in the special
‘exception zone. In addition, staff is proposing to permit any covered
walkways to encroach into required setbacks in order to promote active
transportation and provide the needed safety and shelter from the elements.

ii) Parking

‘A parking calculation has been provided in the Planning Rationale submitted
by Fotenn (Planning Consultant) which outtines the number of parking spaces
required based on the new addition only. The calculation, as required in
Zoning Byaw 050-2014 is based on all existing beds available within the
hospital (existing and proposed). As staff are unclear as to specific number of
beds within the hospital and in review of the proposed site plan, Planning
Staff are suggesting that a set number of parking spaces be implement based
‘on the floor area of the building.

The Transportation Planning Study, prepared by Stantec, June 2013
concluded that the future parking demand based on the proposed expansion
‘would be 780 spaces; However, Stantec has advised staf that there are 798
spaces currently provided for. Based on the above figures and the possibilty
Of slight variation in building size staff believe that the set number of parking
spaces should be set at 780 spaces and tied to a maximum floor area. This
‘number is derived from spliting the difference between the projected and the
proposed parking spaces rather than placing a specific number of spaces per
square metre of the building.

Tying the number of spaces to a maximum floor area will ensure that any
further development after the proposed expansion described in this report will
require additional parking at a more suitable rate. Staff belleves that the new
rale should be equal to that of a clinic or medical office and set at 1.0 space
per 15.0 square metres of gross floor area.

Iv) _ Driveway Access

Zoning Bylaw 050-2014 defines Driveway Access as “the depressed area
and/or curb-cut on a public highway which allows vehicular access onto
private property, and which inclides that area travelled on pubilo property
after leaving the driving lane(s)". Based on the definition above, it has been
regular practice thatthe Planning Department measures the curb separation
distance atthe property ine.

Upon review of the Transportation Study and the site plan submitted, staff has
found that multiple entranceways exceed the maximum permitted. Although
the isle widths within the site meet the zoning regulations, the entranceway
widths need to be addressed.

‘Specifically, there are four (4) entrances that need special exception in order
to permit the proposed design. Two (2) of the entranceways are located on
Bartholomew Street and are shown at 11.1 metres and 120 metres,
respectfully. The 11.1 metre entrance is used for access and egress to
controlled parking area, while the 12.0 metre entrance is to the main shipping
and receiving area.

‘The third entrance leads to the southem side of the main entrance and is
located on Pear Street. This entrance is requested to be 10:3 motros in sizo.
‘Siaff have no concem with the proposed size ofthe entrance as this area will
be used for patient drop-off and will allow easy of access for public transit.
The last entrance that needs special exception, with the stop-up and close
Charles Street, is the Charles Street entrance at Ormond Street. As Charles
Street would be a private entrance, the width of 15.7 metres needs to be
addressed. As the above Driveway Access points exceed the maximums
Permitted, staff is recommending that the specific widths be addressed
through the special exception zone.

¥) Building Design Elements

Based on review of the “Brockville General Hospital Rail and Road Traffic
Noise and Vibration Impact Feasibility Study’ conducted by Stantec, dated 22
‘October 2015, there are specific design elements that need to be addressed
in the construction of the building. These elements are to improve and health
land safety of those within the hospital and provide a safe environment from
the built environment.

Fropound Zoning 8y-aw Anandmant for Brocka avert Noapia Expansion
‘Sct: 7078, 410, and 108 Cares Sts 4,100, 18,126,134

Elements that need to be incorporated into the design of the building include
‘special window glazing, specific construction measures for the exterior walls
‘2s well as internal air conditioning. Staff is recommending that these specific
<design elements be addressed through the special exception zone.

Based on review of the above comments received, the planning rationale submitted by
FoTenn Consutting, the redesign of the parking area and the proposed land transfers, staff
recommend that the request for rezoning be approved in order to permit the proposed
‘expansion and redevelopment of the Brockville General Hospital

‘The subject property Is located in a prominent location within the City, is generally
compatible with surrounding uses, is similar in height to existing structures and represents
appropriate infil development within the urban area. The proposal is also utilizing existing
services and is proposing public transit stops within the site,

‘Should the recommendation above be accepted by Council, the proposed zone would read
similar to the following:

"

8 (Brockville General Hospital)

‘The uses permitted in the I1 - 8 Zone shall be those permitted within the 11 —
General Institutional Zone. The zone provisions for the I1 - 8 General Institutional
‘Special Exception Zone shall be the same as for the It ~ General Institutional Zone
save and except forthe following:

Minimum Front Yard Ormond Street | 4.77 m from property line, not the original
(Measured to the building face) street centre line as per Section 3.52.
Minimum Parking Requirement "780.0 parking spaces for the first
40,400.0 square metres of gross floor
| area, and 1.0 space per 15.0 square
metres of gross floor area thereafter.
Design Elements | 1. Allwindows must be double glazed
‘or better to meet the minimum
STC-35 requirement.
2. Wall construction must meet the
minimum STC-50 rating
3. Central Air Conditioning shall be
provided forall patient rooms.

Notwithstanding the yard provisions of Zoning Bylaw 050-2014, covered walkways,
shall be permitted in any required yard, except where excluded in a comer visibility
triangle ora planting strip in accordance with the provisions of this By-law.

‘Reliant: ——_FoTonn Coneutantsne-

Notwithstanding the driveway access provisions of Zoning By-law 050-2014, a
‘maximum of two (2) driveway accesses measuring up to a maximum width of 12.0
metres each, may be located on Bartholomew Street; one (1) driveway access:
measuring up to a maximum of 10.3 metres may be located on the Pearl Street
entrance and one (1) driveway access measuring up to a maximum of 15.7 metres.
may be located on Ormond Street. All other driveway access points must be in
compliance with Section 3.33 b) iv) of Zoning By-law 050-2014."

Other Issues Raised at the Public Meeting (Minutes Attached as Schedul

‘On 7 July 2015, a Public Meeting was held by the Economic Development Planning
Development Committee. The following text addresses issues raised which are not
otherwise addressed previously in this report:

Noise (Pear! Street):

Concer was brought forward relating to the potential noise from rooftop heating/cooling
systems. To ensure that noise is adequately addressed, it was stated by Ms. Jennifer
Garrah, FoTenn Consulting that a noise study is required and will be reviewed by the
Ministry of the Environment to ensure compliance with provincial regulations.

Street Trees:

The need to retain 2s many mature street trees was presented by a neighbouring property
‘owner. landscaping plan is required as part ofthe site plan control submission and will
be reviewed by staff to ensure that ample amounts of vegetation are being and retained
‘and proposed around the site.

No additional comments were received at the Public Meeting.
‘Site Pian Considerations:

All lands within the limits of the City for Brockville are subject to Site Plan Control Approval
as established by City of Brockville By-law 33-86, as amended. Accordingly, prior to
development, the Brockville General Hospital is subject to site plan approval. This process
tensures appropriate design, servicing and compliance with zoning provisions. It also
provides the City with the opportunity to impose conditions of approval, financial and
otherwise, including cash-in-lieu of parkland dedication, if it so chooses.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

‘As stated in the Analysis section of this report, the proposed zoning amendment is
‘consistent with the PPS and with Official Pian.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

‘All costs associated with the rezoning and with respect to the redevelopment are the
responsibilty of BGH.

CONCLUSION:

Following review of the PPS, the Official Plan, Zoning By-law 050-2014, as well as
‘submissions recelved respecting the request for Zoning By-law amendment for the
Brockville General Hospital, itis reasonable to rezone the subject properties.

‘The proposed amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014 will intensify, utilize existing
services/infrastructure and add to the availability of care beds available within our
‘community. The proposed development will not only benefit the community but the entire
Brockwille region.

‘The recommendations at the beginning of this report reflect this conclusion.

Front Yard Parking Agreement

10 Elm Street, Brockville

RECOMMENDATION

agreement with Mr. Terry Stranges, 10 Elm Street, Brockville, for the
encroachment of a portion of a shed that encroaches onto the Elm Street
road allowance to @ maximum of 3.71 metres (12.2 ft.) and onto the rear
open space area to a maximum of 3.2 metres (10.5 ft.) and a front yard
parking pad, that encroaches onto the Elm Street road allowance to a
maximum of 5.38 metres (17.7 ft.) in length.

ORIGIN

This matter arises from a request by Mr. Terry Stranges, Owner of the
property, upon application for a building permit for the construction of a
shed and a condition of a decision from the Committee of Adjustment as a
result of an application for a minor variance.

ANALYSIS

‘An application has been received in the Clerk's Office from the property
owner, Mr. Terry Stranges, for the encroachment of a portion of a shed onto
the Elm Street road allowance and onto the rear open space area as well as
a front yard parking pad. The encroachment agreement will include the shed

face of the encroaching shed. Should the shed need to be moved for
‘any reason in order for the City to maintain the right-of-way or any
plant within it, it shall be the responsibility and cost of the owner to do
50.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION
‘As per the City of Brockville Fees and Charges By-law, there is a fee for
processing the encroachment agreement, which would be deposited to 01-4-
01032-0603.

CONCLUSIONS:

‘As they are no objections raised by City departments to entering into an
