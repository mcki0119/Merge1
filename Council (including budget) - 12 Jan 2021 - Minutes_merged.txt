Service Delivery Plan

Intent of the Service Delivery Plan

» Create discussion and awareness at an early
stage.

» For Council to agree on a list of services are
the services Council wishes to discuss and
potentially modify service levels.

» Are there other services Council wishes to
discuss?

Covid Conscious Service Delivery
Plan vs Operating Budget Approval

- Ata very basic level, no one know what the
pandemic will in 2021. The City wants
to be prepared, as much as we can, to be able
to respond and rebound. This takes some
level of resources.

- Establishing an operating budget that has
either covid related expenses in the base
budget or inflated revenues will throw all
future variance reporting off, along with
future budgets.

RP ££ -

What is next ?

» For staff to report back on those identified
services.

» For Council to make decisions which modify
service levels.

» Timely public and user group
communications.

» Ongoing monitoring and report back on
ssues, financial oversight and enforcement,
