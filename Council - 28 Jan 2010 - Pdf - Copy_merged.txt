Budget Notice of Motion by Councillor Noble
Brockville Public Library Board Accounting Services

WHEREAS the City is installing a new financial system and the library is the only
outside City agency stil doing its own accounting whereas all the other city
agencies find having the city performing the accounting functions to be mutually
beneficial

AND WHEREAS because the present approach increases the workload in City
Hall consolidations;

AND WHEREAS the City does not wish to be funding accounting work at the
library provided it can be done at no extra cost at City Hall and would rather the
City’s Library funding be used for Library programs, services and the collection.

‘THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

+ The City is to conduct a study to be completed no later than August 31,
2010 of the City’s new financial system's appropriateness to the Library:
and

+ Ifthe Treasurer and the City’s Auditor determine that the City can provide
the accounting services to the Library without the City incurring extra
staffing costs then:

> The Library accounting functions, to the degree determined by the
study as the optimal arrangement , will be assumed by the City at no
additional cost to the Library prior to December 31, 2010 in a
‘manner similar to all the other City Boards, Committee's and
‘Agencies
