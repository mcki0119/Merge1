Hi, I'm Nancy MeLuskey. Tve been on a library board for nine years and I have been board chair
for 6, Ym here to discuss CEO evaluation. Evaluation by its very nature makes people
uncomfortable because its judgmental bu it isan essential part of your duties as a library board,
‘Your CEO is entrusted to carry out your direction. Without tools fo evaluate progress you cannot
‘know if your wishes are being cutried out. Thanks for listening.
