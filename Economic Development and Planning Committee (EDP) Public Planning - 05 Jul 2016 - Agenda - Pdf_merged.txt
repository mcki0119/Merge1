RECOMMENDATION

THAT Report 2016-088-07 be received as information and that a report on this matter be

future meeting,

PURPOSE

To provide information for purposes of conducting a Public Meeting under the Planning Act
respecting an Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014.

BACKGROUND

1115 Millwood Avenue, is the northerly portion of the lands which have been under
construction since November 2014, originally slated for two 12 unit condominium buildings.
Currentty, one (1) of the building is complete and the owner of the property wishes to construct,
a five (5) unit townhouse block on the residual lands rather than the originally proposed condo
building

‘An Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 has been
submitted by Jane Almond, MCIP, RPP, acting for the property owner, for lands located at
1115 Millwood Avenue The application for amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014, if
‘approved, would rezone the subject lands from R6 — Multiple Residential Zone to R5 — Multiple
Residential Special Exception Zone to permit the construction of a five (5) unit townhouse
block with a reduced frontage and a reduction to the rear yard setback.

Initialy requested was a rear yard reduction of 5.9 metres from the required 7.5 metres;
however, due to a redesign of the townhouse block, the owner is now requesting 4.9 metre
rear yard setback. This amended request is due to the redesign of the townhouse block as
well as the location of the property line on the south side. Also requested is a reduction in the
‘minimum required lot frontage for a townhouse block, from 30.0 metres to 25.3 metres,

In addition to the above requests, Planning Staff would like to make Councillors aware of a

Page 8 of 15,

request that was made through the application and circulated to agencies and neighbours
regarding the landscaped open space provision. Requested at the time of application was a
reduction to the minimum landscaped open space from 30.0% to 23.9%, This request was
made in error on the application and a reduction is not needed as the property has adequate
‘open space provided at 60.2%, as shown on attached Schedule "A" to this report.

‘Subject: D14-013 (1109 Miwood Ave)

Lorraine / Andrew:

CCRCA staff have reviewed the application for Zoning By-law Amendment 014-013 forthe proposed zoning change at
1109 Millwood Avenue. The owner proposes to amend the zoning to permit a S unit townhouse development on the
‘north portion ofthe property in place ofthe previously approved 12 unit condominium building. We do not object in
principle to the proposed amendment to permit the townhouses. However, since the proposed site-specific zone
Includes a reduction in the rear yard setback these changes may have implications that could affect the development’s
ablity to meet CRCA minimum hazard setbacks (13.5 m minimum to toe of slope, 6 m minimum from 2:100 year flood
elevation) and may aso affect on-site stormwater management.

“The exact location ofthe previously proposed condo building was partly a function of specif constraints associated
with the food plan and erosion hazard and stormwater management capacty/design on the subject property. The
‘conceptual Site Pian submitted withthe proposed zoning amendment shows changes to the location and
‘configuration of development that may oF may not comply with natural hazard setbacks and stormwater
‘management requirements for this site.

‘Therefore, itis our opinion that itis critical that 2 revise Site Plan, including a Landscape and Grading Plan, and a
new (or updated) Stormwater Management Plan be submitted for review by the CRCA and Cit of Brockville
Engineering staff prio to approval ofthe proposed zoning amendment. Approval of an amendment to permit a
specific setback reduction without necessary technical review would, in our opinion, be inappropriate at this time.

[We formally recommend deferral of application 014-013 untl such time that the dacuments noted above are submitted
tothe satisfaction ofthe CRCA and Cty of Broce,
