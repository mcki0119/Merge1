REQUEST FOR TRANSFER

OF FUNDS

RECOMMENDED

‘THAT Council authorize the transfer, of $6,129.47, from the Brockville Museum Reserve
Fund (account 02-5-191954-6436) to be used to reimburse costs associated with re-
cataloguing, preserving and storing objects in the Cossitt Collection incurred in 2017.

PURPOSE

To have Council approve the transfer from the Brockville Museum Reserve Fund to
‘cover the costs associated with the conservation of artifacts from the Cossitt Estate,

BACKGROUND and ANALYSIS

When the Brockville Museum received a significant number of artifacts from the Cossitt
Estate in 2006, it also received a considerable monetary donation to help cover the
costs of maintaining the extensive collection (by-law 005-2006).

Between October 2016 and March 2017, the Brockville Museum hired an intern to re-
catalogue the 313 objects in this collection, carry-out conservation treatments, upload
information on the objects onto our online database, and properly re-pack and store all
313 objects. The intern’s salary was partially funded by a grant from Canadian
Heritage, however the balance of the salary, and all materials and supplies were paid by
the museum with the expectation that the funds would ultimately be transferred from the
Cossitt Reserve.

The requested funds will be used specifically for the purposes identified in the by-law
which set up the reserve account in 2006,

L. White
Manager of Strategic Initiatives
RECOMMENDATION:

THAT a hotel tax at a proposed rate of 4 per cent on all Brockville transient
accommodations effective May 1, 2018 be approves

THAT the necessary bylaw be enacted; |

‘THAT the Township of Ellzabethtown-Kitley be encouraged to Implement a similar
transient accommodation tax.

PURPOSE
To provide Members of Council with the legislative requirements of the "Transient
‘Accommodation Tax” and provide recommendations on the development, |
‘administration and use of the tax collected.

BACKGROUND

Municipalities have been asking for new revenue tools to meet growing financial
challenges. On May 17, 2017, in response to municipalities’ request, the Province
enacted Bill 127, Stronger, Healthier Ontario Act, 2017, providing single and lower-
tier municipalities the authority to levy a transient accommodations tax (hotel tax).
‘The legislation states that municipalities that adopt a hotel tax and have an existing
Destination Marketing Fee (DMF) program in place are required to share the hotel
tax revenue with the appropriate not-for-profit tourism organization in an amount
that matches the total revenue generated by the existing DMF program. Where
such a program does not exist, as in Brockville's case, at least 50 per cent of the
ret hotel tax revenue is to be allocated to the respective Destination Marketing
Organization (DMO) or an eligible tourism entity.

Ontario Regulation 435/17 5. (3) states that an “eligible tourism entity” means a
non-profit entity whose mandate includes the promotion of tourism in Ontario oF in
@ municipality and that “any amounts paid to an eligible tourism entity under

subsection (2) shall be used by the eligible tourism entity for the exclusive purpose


Page 8 of 20,

Report 2018-02-01
Hotel Tax

of promoting tourism.” For greater certainty, "promotion of tourism” Includes the
development of tourism products.

‘The Chamber of Commerce has been an advocate for a Brockville hotel tax for
many years. Although the fee was never able to be implemented universally in
Brockville, the Comfort Inn did implement the fee in July 2009 to July 2010
‘garnering $61,828. Those funds were used to advertise in the Visitor Guide, create
a new website for Brockville Tourism support the 2010 Canada 55+ Games and
Fred Page Cup, multi media campaigns (T.V., radio, and print) in Upper New York,
Ottawa and Montreal

In Gananoque, Thousand Islands Accommodation Partners has had a 3 per cent
DMF in place for since 2009, The fund is administered by the stakeholders of the
not-for-profit with no interference from the Town of Gananoque. There is currently
‘no Intention for the Town of Gananoque to alter this arrangement. The City of
Kingston has a DMF of 3% as well through Kingston Accommodation Partners Inc.

ANALYSIS.

‘There are currently ten accommodation providers offering approximately 343,
rooms. This includes bed and breakfasts, hotels and motels. With occupancy rates
of 67% and an average daly rate of $113.38 per night (see Attachment 1); a 4
percent hotel tax would generate approximately $380,983 in revenue annually.

‘Administration

‘Staff recommends that a simplified remittance model should be used similar to that
Used by businesses to remit HST to the Canada Revenue Agency. Accommodation
business would be required to complete a Municipal Accommodation Tax Return and
remit it to the City on a monthly basis. Staff would follow up where returns are not
emitted and perform regular audits of remittances to ensure accuracy. This model
Would minimize the cost of administration.

Implementation

A hotel tax on Brockville accommodation business can be implemented effective
May 1, 2018. This would allow time to engage all accommodation businesses as
well as develop necessary policies around the application of the tax (e.g., should
the tax be added to the total price where amenities such as continental breakfast
are built into the price or to optional amenities such as valet or room service),
exemptions, refund eligibility, audit processes, late payment charges and appeals.
This would also provide time for accommodation businesses to upgrade their billing
systems to include this tax and implement administrative processes associated with
its remittance to the City.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘There are no policy implications at this time,

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS.

‘The regulation states that 50% of the net hotel tax must be allocated to one or
more eligible tourism entities (not-for-profit whose mandate includes the promotion
of tourism in the municipality). Any amounts paid to an eligible tourism entity shall
be used by the eligible tourism entity for the exclusive purpose of promoting
tourism. The regulation also states that the municipality is able to apply a
reasonable cost of collecting and administering the tax against the total revenue.

The City of Brockville has a contract with the Chamber of Commerce to provide
Tourism services for approximately $188,000 per year until December 31, 2020.
The Chamber of Commerce is a not-for-profit and therefore the City could fund that
contractual obligation from the hotel tax and be compliant with the regulation, The
ity could choose to fund the contract for Tourism directly from the hotel tax
Instead of the municipal levy.

1f 50% of the net hotel tax was higher than the contract amount, the City could
choose to either supplement the tourism contract or redirect the funds to another
eligible tourism entity. The remaining 50% of the funds, less any administration
fees, can be allocated at the discretion of the municipality.

CONCLUSIONS

‘The City of Brockville has made significant investment in tourism products
(Aquatarium, Railway Tunnel and Parking) and festival programming (Tall Ships and
Rails to Trails festival).

‘The establishment of a hotel tax will support the maintenance and growth of
tourism in the City of Brockville.

Based on available records, the proposed sign, if approved, would coincide with multiple
signs already located within the City of Brockville. A key point that staff would lke toa bring
attention to is that this sign is proposed to advertise one (1) tenant, not multiple tenants as
the other permitted signs within the City are.

This application has been circulated for comment with the following results:

‘Planning Department-Building Division: no objection to the proposal. A permit is
required prior to work commencing

+ Brockville Police: No issue provided it does not interfere with the view ofthe traffic
control signal.
Environmental Service Department: Not opposed to the application.
Operations Department: No objection. The sign appears to be setback sufficiently
from a traffic perspective
Brockvile Fire Department: No concern
Ministry of Transportation: No concern at ths time; however, a permit is required
from our office

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

None

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

All costs associated with this application are the responsibility of the Owner and/or
Developer.

CONCLUSION:

‘The amendment is to permit an oversized pylon sign with a height of 9.14 metres and a
total sign area of 38.1 m?. As the proposed ground sign is similar to other approved
ground signs on lands within the City, staff have no concern with the proposed increase. It
is recommended that the proposed amendment to City of Brockville Sign By-law 84-89 be
approved.

2018-005-01 S. MacDonald
Encroachment Agreement City Clerk
11-13 Beecher Street, Brockville L. Murray

Deputy City Clerk
Recommendation

THAT Council authorize the Mayor and Clerk to execute an encroachment
agreement with the Toronto-Dominion Bank, for the encroachment of
framed steps onto the Beecher Street road allowance to a maximum of 1.19
metres.

Origin

This matter arises from a request by Davis Webb LLP, solicitors for the
mortgages of the property, as a condition of approval for an application of
Minor Variances.

Analysis

Applications have been received in the Clerk's Office from the property
mortgagees, The Toronto Dominion Bank, for the encroachments of a
portion of the existing frame steps at 11 and 13 Beecher Street.
(Attachments 1 to Report 2018-005-01)

‘Through circulation to various City Departments, comments from the
Environmental Services Department were noted:

+ The owner of the property will be responsible for all cost for removal
and replacement of the steps if work on the City road allowance
require them to be removed.

‘As well the property owners were required to get minor variance approval,
as part of the front porch stairs encroach on City lands. The minor variance
was approved with the following conditions

1, That an encroachment Agreement be applied for and obtained from
Council for the encroachment of the stairs onto the Beecher Street
road allowance.

Page 19 of 20,

2018-005-01
Encroachment Agreement, 11-13 Beecher Street Page 2

11-13 Beecher Street, Brockville

Financial Consideration
As per the City of Brockville Fees and Charges By-law, there is a fee for
processing the encroachment agreement, which would be deposited to 01-4-
01032-0603.

Conclusions:

Based on the situation that the encroachments are a condition of the
approvals for Minor Variances, it is staff's recommendation that the
encroachment at 11 and 13 Beecher Street be permitted. However, the
matter is at the pleasure of Council.
