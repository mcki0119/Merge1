Project Researcher: Immigrant Entrepreneur Attraction

J. Schoemaker Holmes provided an overview of her research from the past
ine months.

Councillor Baker noted that many of these strategies are already in place in
one form or another and he would not support a report requesting the
creation of a new position to undertake this project. It should be more of a
regional approach. Some of the recommendations could be implemented
with our existing staff or with updates to some of our programs and
processes.

CARRIED

Economic Development and Planning Committee (EDP) Committee Minutes -
Tuesday, December 06, 2016

Councillor Kalivas expressed his concern with starting on Phase 2 of the
project before Phase 1 is complete and that Council has not been provided
information about the funding that has been confirmed for Phases 1 and 2.
There is additional concern with regard to contamination of the site. Mr.
Cosgrove confirmed that an environmental report was completed 10 years
ago and would need to be updated.

Councillor Earle also noted his concern starting on Phase 2 before Phase 1 Is
complete. He also noted that the proposal to have tour bus traffic to and
from the site could be problematic. He also asked if there has been a
commitment from CN with regard to the access for the Brock Trail under the
CN tracks. Councillor LeSueur indicated that an application was submitted to
CN for access for the Brock Trail and he expects a response before the end
of the year.

Councillor Baker expressed his frustration on having requests for Phase 2 of
the project coming forward before Phase 1 is complete. He asked for more
detailed budget information for Phases 1 and 2. He noted that Council has
yet to provide their vision for the project/Phase 2.

Councillor Deery noted the concern with getting Phase 1 done before Phase
2 starts but his vision is that one doesn’t work without the other. He noted
that no Brockville firms submitted a bid for this work. He would like an
update of where the project is financially for each of the phases.

Mayor Henderson indicated the need for an update regarding the finances.
He noted his concern with the commercial aspect of Phase 2 and the viability
and/or operational costs of the commercial component. The land will be
developed but financing is important.

Councillor Blanchard noted that he does not support Phase 2. If this motion
Is approved today it would be as if you support Phase 2 proceeding.

Councillor Baker indicated that he has not yet heard any information about
the operating budget for Phase 2. What is the BRTC vision for Phase 2. He
Indicated his support for using the (secured) funding for Phase 2 on bullding
Phase 2, but not spending money on creating renderings and taking them
out to the public. It seems backwards. Wants consensus on the conceptual
plan for Phase 2 and then go to design/renderings.

Councillor LeSueur feels that it is the experts who should be providing the
concepts for Phase 2.
