Mayor's Remarks

Mayor Wren thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the City is looking great in
preparation for the Canada Day long-weekend.

On behalf of the City, Mayor Wren noted he attended the retirement celebration of
Tom Russell, Executive Director with the 1000 Islands Community Development
Corporation for over 35 years. He noted Mr. Russell has been a tremendous
champion for the region, including the City of Brockville, and through his advocacy
and leadership, a great many investments were made and projects supported. His
Worship mentioned Mr. Russell as a greatly deserving Citizen of the Year when he
was recognized by the Chambers of Commerce in 2023. He offered a warm.
welcome to Mr. Russell's successor, Trish McNamara and said the City looks
forward to working with her.

Mayor Wren announced he met recently with the two local Rotary Clubs who
wished to make the City aware that, after organizing the Santa Claus Parade for
many years, they are not able to continue due to the reduced and aging
volunteers. He thanked the clubs for their past efforts and noted the request for a
new organization willing to take on the event. He said any interested organizations
should contact the Mayor's Office.

the tunnel fully operational by Canada Day and this goal has been achieved with
time to spare. He said staff continue to explore long-term solutions to be
presented in the coming weeks and thanked staff of the operations department for
their efforts.

Mayor Wren outlined various Canada Day long weekend events including the 15th
