WITHDRAWN

‘COUNCIL REMUNERATION

Moved by: Councillor Williams

Due to the concern of the overall Canadian economy, as well as
the individual future of our Brockville residents, this isa time of
which companies are looking at their cost, elficiencies, and
effectiveness. Having recently completed a City Service Review
regarding our efficiencies:

IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED THAT City Councillors continue
to lead by example, by not receiving a salary increase for the
years 2009 and 2010.

CARRIED

INCREASING SEWAGE CAPACITY RECOMMENDED

Moved by: Councillor Noble

WHEREAS the City of Brockville has serious capacity concerns at
the sewage treatment plant creating eventual limitations on future
residential development and is spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars to address the problem.

AND WHEREAS the best possible solution is one that cuts
residents waterisewer bils in half, reduces their energy bil,

‘saves the city money in water filtration plant and distribution
system costs, reduces the flows in the underground piping system,
‘and majorly reduces the existing demand on the city sewage
treatment faclity.

AND WHEREAS technologies now exist and are in widespread
use in many world jurisdictions that have the potential to easily
reduce residential water consumption by 30% and with the best
products 40%. This is a direct saving to everyone and the
‘sewage treatment plant load,

AND WHEREAS the major components of residential usage are

Page 1 of 18

City of Brockville
Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, March 10, 2009

showers, toilets and faucets.

AND WHEREAS efficient shower heads save 50 % of the water
usage and given that a shower uses 60% hot water save
significant water heating energy costs as well. Tollet usage can
bbe reduced by 68% and faucet usage by 50%. Reduced faucet
usage also results in some hot water heating energy savings.

AND WHEREAS the cost of efficient shower heads and low-
volume screw on faucet aerators is minimal and installation easy.

AND WHEREAS most newer toilets in the city use 13 lters per
flush and can still be purchased (banned in the USA) and many
older ones use significantly more.

AND WHEREAS the properly designed 6 liter flush tollets use only
‘46% of the water (the poorly designed ones take two flushes for
solids and even that is less than 13)

‘AND WHEREAS the Europeans have used dual lush toilets for
‘some time (Iwo actuators...one that uses 4.2 liters for liquids and
the second using 6 liters for major solids) and these are now
available in Canada and dropping in price from the original $600
‘or more (¢.g.$276.00). The most frequent fush cycle is the 4.2
liter one and it uses 30% less water than a 6 liter and 68% less
than most toilets in Brockville,

AND WHEREAS these technologies have the benefits of halving
the water/sewer bill and energy costs of end users because of
reduced consumption and also reduce the energy and chemicals
costs to pump, fer, chlorinate, fluoridate and treat ultraviolet
water and free up capacity in the underground piping system and.
have the potential to reduce the residential load on the sewage
treatment plant by 30%,

[AND WHEREAS an incentive plan for householders to change.
their shower heads to low volume ones that are equally effective
but more efficient and install reduced volume screw-on aerators,
‘and fo switch to low water consumption toilets (or better still dual
‘lush models) is less expensive than tearing up and rebuilding
roadways and replacing underground piping

AND WHEREAS unnecessary water must be pumped
Chlorinated and then re-pumped as sewage and treated

AND WHEREAS this is a green initiative and likely eligible for
{federal funding especially as a pilot trial initiative and given that
the Federal and Provincial governments are continually being
asked to help fund huge capital projects to deal with the end of the
cycle instead of focusing on reducing the demand

Page 12 of 18

City of Brockville
Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, March 10, 2009

AND WHEREAS such a project could get the city very favourable
national media exposure as a promising green initiative.

AND WHEREAS reducing consumption is a green initiative which
is in keeping with one of the stated priority goals in the developing
city vision and plans.

AND WHEREAS itis simply good sense to reduce consumption
rather than circulate and process unnecessary water.

AND WHEREAS such a project is a marketing, conceptual and
‘economies project which doesn't require hard pressed operations
department staff involvement except peripherally and could be
given to a summer business program student to formulate and test
market.
‘THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that a special reserve fund be
created funded from the waterisewer rate to allow staff to develop
a financial incentive and marketing plan to induce citizens to
replace shower heads and toilets to approved more efficient
‘ones. The 2009 contribution will match the funds budgeted to
investigate the sources of extraneous water entering the sanitary
‘sewer system ($80,000). The funds will be used to design and test
market a pilot incentive project. The test marketing phase will not
‘proceed until the plan is brought forward to the Operations
‘Committee and receives Council approval. Unused funds, if any
vill be returned to the wastewater rate reserve fund.
