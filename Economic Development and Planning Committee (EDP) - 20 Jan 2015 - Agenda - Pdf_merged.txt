‘The applicant has provided the Planning Department with a copy of the following
inspection reports to satisfy condition 2.3:

‘= "Structural inspection Report, Parkland Apartments, 167 Pearl Street East,
Brockvile, Ontario” Issued by Kostuch Engineering Limited, 07 December
1987.

Letter: TROW to Faurschou, dated 02 November 2012.

‘+ ‘Observation Report for Unit 4, Lennox Condominium Corporation (L.C.C.
4124), 167 Pearl Street East, Brockville, Ontario" dated 02 November 2012”.

‘The above-noted letter and observation report, dated 02 November 2012 satisfy the
requirements of Condition 2.3:

2.4 THATall common elements of 167 Pear! Street are to be inspected, at the expense
of the Owner, by @ qualified Professional Engineer, licensed in Ontario, describing
the condition of the building and listing any and all repairs and improvements
required to ensure that the building complies with all applicable Provincial and
Municipal regulations.

The applicant has not undertaken to retain a professional engineer to inspect “all
‘common elements of 167 Pearl Street’.

In various discussions with the applicant, Mr. Sheridan, itis apparent that since the
application is for the conversion of an existing apartment unt to be added to the
existing 11 residential condominium units within L.C.C. #24, and given that L.C.C.
#24 is a valid operational condominium corporation responsible for all aspects of
maintenance and operation of the building, common elements, parking and the
grounds, the applicant has stated that it is unreasonable to hire a professional
engineer to re-inspect what's to be maintained under L.C.C. #24. In addition, the
letter from TROW dated 02 November 2012 states the following

“Since this past spring, the undersigned as a representative of Trow has
conducted two separate visits; one for an Environmental Site Assessment
and the other as part of conducting the Reserve Fund Study for the
corporation. As part ofthe latter site visit, Trow did note that the roofing for
the building was of arecent installation and that many of the residential units
as well as common area stairwells were in the process of renovation. During
Trow’s site visits, no deficiencies of structural concern were observed.
However, it must be noted that investigation of an intrusive nature or with

regards to building code compliance and/or technical audits of the buildings
‘common elements were not within the scope of Trow’s mandate and as such
were not conducted as part of either the Environmental Site Assessment or
the Reserve Fund Study."

Accordingly, the applicant has requested verbally that this requirement be removed
{rom the conditions for condominium conversion.

The Planning Department has reviewed the available information and the rationale
put forward by the applicant and is in agreement. Condition 2.4 is therefore
considered to have been met subject to Council approval to modify Condition 2.4 to
remove the reference to inspection by a Professional Engineer.

2.5 THAT all repairs and improvements identified under the engineer's report(s), as
noted above, are to be made at the expense of the Owner prior to final approval
with confirmation of completion by a professional engineer.

The following items were identified as being outstanding in the EXP report dated 02
November 2012:

+ Kitchenette spatial area does not meet current minimum are under the OBC.

‘The TROW report identified this as a potential deficiency but also noted that i
‘was constructed prior to current OBC requirements. The EXP report also noted
thatthe City may be wiling to "grandfather the current kitchenette configuration
as the units an open concept design. Discussion with B. Caskenette, CBO for
the City, has confirmed that the opinion of EXP is reasonable. Accordingly, this
item is considered to be met.

‘+ Electrical Outlet receptacie for the bathroom does not meet current OESC
requirements.

Four-0-One Electric confirmed, in writing, that new lights a a separate GFC!
receptacle were installed on 16 November 2012.

states that clean out raps are not in place according to section 7.2.3.1 of the

acceptable.”

‘As of 04 December 2014, the three outstanding issues identified in the EXP Report
have been resolved as noted above.

Based on the fore-going information submitted by qualified professionals, the
applicant has requested verbally that the necessity of an inspection by a
Professional Engineer be removed from the conditions for condominium conversion.

‘The Planning Department has reviewed the above-noted materials, the nature of
the repairs and the rationale put forward by the applicant and is in agreement.
Condition 2.5 is therefore considered to have been met subject to Council approval
‘to modify Condition 2.5 to remove the reference to “confirmation of completion bya
professional engineer’.

free of charge, to prospective purchasers before they enter into a binding

November 2014, confirming that once the unit is available for sale, a copy of the
Inspection reports), pre and post conditions, shall be provided to the purchaser
before they enter into a binding agreement of purchase and sale. In addition, the
‘Owner has confirmed that confirmation of the above shall be provided to the City of
Brockville.

2.7 THAT the Owner shall provide, to the existing tonant(s) of the subject unit at the
date of granting of Draft condominium conversion approval, active, physical
assistance, for a period of three (3) years from the date of Conditional Approval, to

Proposed Phased Condominium Description:
‘APhased Condominium is described as follows:

"A. phased condominium permits individually owned units and common
elements to be added to @ condominium corporation in phases, over a
‘maximum of 10 years. The phases occur by an amendment to the existing
declaration and description to re-describe the condominium property with the
additional phase. Only standard condominiums may be phased.”

Phase | of the proposed development consists of one twelve (12) unit residential
condominium building, access/egress driveway, nine (9) parking spaces of the ten (10)
at-grade parking lot spaces, landscaping on the south half of the site and a common
children’s play area. The undeveloped area of the site shall be graded and seeded and
sodded where required to ensure soil stability. Phase | is proposed to be ready for
‘occupancy in August 2015.

Phase II of the proposed development consists of one twelve (12) unit residential
condominium building, completion of the at-grade parking, landscaping on the north half
of the site and completion of all outstanding site work. Phase Il is proposed to be ready
for occupancy in January 2016.

Limited Approval:

Ontario Regulation 48/01, s 85, to the Condominium Act S.0. 1998, Ch 19., limits the
addition of phases to @ maximum of ten (10) years from the date of registration of a
phased Plan of Condominium. No additions or amendments are permitted beyond the
ten year time frame.

This limited approval accommodates the time frame for development of Phase | and
Phase Il as the applicant has stated that “The goal is to have the first building ready for
‘occupancy in August 2015, and the second building ready in January 2016".

Clause 6 of the Site Plan Control Agreement reads as follows:

“6. a) THAT ifa building permit has not been issued for Phase 1 of the development
within twelve (12) months of the date of approval of this Agreement then this
‘Agreement will become null and void, and a new application for Site Plan
‘Approval must be submitted and approved by the City prior to any building permit
being issued.

6.6) If a building permit has not been issued for Phase 2 of the development within
thirty-six (36) months of the date of issuance of the Building Permit for Phase 1,

or if at any time, a building permit issued for Phase 2 is revoked, then this
Agreement will become null and void as it pertains to Phase 2, and a new
application for Phase 2 - Site Plan Approval must be submitted and approved by
the City prior to any further building permit being issued.”

‘Accordingly, Clause 6 effectively has a time line of 4 years from 2014, the date on

development. Should Phase II not have drawn a Building Permit within the allotted time

‘on economic development initiatives. The City retained the tourism product
development responsibilty.

‘+ There have been 5 renewals ofthe tourism service contract for the Brockville and
District Chamber of Commerce based on positive performance and the delivery of
‘tourism programming with cost efficiencies in particular. The leverage of external
funds for the Chamber's Regional Program Partnership has been touted
significant asset.

‘+ Some tourism grant initiatives are not available to municipal governments and as
such, another positive benefit for the external service delivery entity.

provide key performance measures associated with delivery of their programming
despite provincial and national decrease in tourism funding over the past four years.

program effectiveness and will continue to engage and mobilize other regionals
partners outside of Brockville on a cooperative marketing basis.

previously approved Tourism contracts with the exception of;
© The extension of the term of the contract to five years enabling a longer term for
strategic planning by the Chamber for Tourism programming which provides an.
‘additional year following the new Council term, and thus enabling the new
