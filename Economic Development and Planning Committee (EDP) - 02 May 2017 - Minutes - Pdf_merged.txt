Andrew McGinnis, Planner reviewed his report for the committee. Andrew
explained that the applicant and the agent have revised the plans in an
attempt to address some of the concerns that arose at the public meeting,
He explained that the report had been circulated to the neighbours who
had requested copies and their comments are mostly favourable.

Councillor Baker had concerns with their only being one parking spot per
unit. He suggested this could become an issue should the use of the
property change in the future. He feels this is just encouraging on street
parking. Councillor Baker asked how the lot area had changed. Mr. Poole of
Eastern Engineering Group responded that initially they were using a plan
from the City's files and then Andrew found a reference plan that showed
differently, so the lot area increased from 960.09 square metres to 1043

square metres.

Councillor Kalivas felt a second story would have been a better choice. He
asked if the owner had considered reducing the units to three in order to
gain more lot area. Lori Dube representing the owner replied that they
really can't afford to lose an apartment or the associated income.
