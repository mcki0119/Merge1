REVISED 2011 9

REPORT TO COUNCIL
February, 2011

DAVID C. PAUL
BROADBAND INITIATIVE DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

RECOMMENDATIONS - DIRECTION of COUNCIL

‘This report is intended to provide a backgrounder to the Easter Ontario Broadband
Network (EORN) presentation and updated data from the 2010 request/report.

REQUEST

The City of Brockville is requested to provide a onetime financial contribution to the
Easter Ontario Broadband Network in the amount of $197,689 being expensed over

a four year period commencing in 2011 in increments of $46,922 annually, for the
purpose of establishing an Eastern Ontario high speed bandwidth representing a total
project cost of $170 million; and further, e

‘+ Brockville has been assured that at least one new Point of Presence (POP) site
will be located within the City limits and that no additional charges will be levied
in the future for this POP.

«The EORN warrants and represents that any telecommunications
supplier/company connecting to the POP will obtain the same pricing benefits as
those available at any other POP that is a part of the EORN network as long as it
exists and for no shorter a period that fourteen years from the completion of the
POP construction;

PURPOSE

To partner with Easter Ontario communities to ensure the establishment of a superhighway
broadband network that will increase coverage to 98% of the Eastern Ontario population
‘and enhanced connectivity up to 10Gb/sec capacity at highly competitive rates for both
existing Intemet Service Providers (ISP's) and residential and commercial users.

Broadband Initiative Report to Budget Commie Page2

BACKGROUND

1998 Runciman/Beatty roundtable forums noted broadband as an action to pursue for
‘an economic development strategy

The 2003 Eastern Ontario Prosperity Report noted the need to establish a high-
speed network.

In 2003, Easter independent Telecommunications Ltd. (EIT) presented a plan to
Industry Canada in support of the Federal initiative to bring broadband connectivity fo
rural Canada. The plan was given serious consideration and was revisited again in
2009 with discussions related to the funding for the Eastem Ontario network. The
Eastem Ontario Wardens Caucus (EOWC) network could form a starting point for a
‘ational rural Broadband Highway in the future.

In 2005 the EOWC confirmed Broadband as the primary priority to advocate for
funding new infrastructure.

In 2009 the federal and provincial government responded by approving $110 milion
€n total project cost of $170 milion with the balance shared with the private sector
representing $50 milion and $10 milion by Eastem Ontario municipalities.

The City of Brockville is being requested to make a financial commitment of $197,680
towards the Project. The United Counties of Leeds and Grenville is making a
‘commitment of $974,976. The City’s contribution is currently part of the County's
payment and ifthe City agrees to participate it will be paid to the United Counties.

All contracts related to the construction and operation of the network will be managed
by EORN inc. The broadband system willbe @ not for profit corporation controled by
the EOWC Inc.

No further fees are to be levied to contributing municipalities as confirmed by EORN

Contributions from the private sector partners will be used to offset the cost of
operations of EORN Inc. and no additional levies from any member of the EOWC Inc
‘or other contributing municipalities will be required

EORN Inc. currently has two offices; one in Prescott and one in the City of
Peterborough.

Ithas been confirmed by EORN that Brockville will be one of the designated POP.
sites.

‘Thore are currently 3 primary Brockville telecommunication firms with total
‘employment of 75 ful ime positions with 85% of their employees living in Brockville.

‘The subject report was compiled from input by RipNet, Eastem Independent
Telecom, City of Brockville’s MIS Department, V.0.P Highway including several
interviews with area stakeholders.

Broadband Initiative Report to Budget Commit Pages

ANALYSIS @

Brockville currently has 100% broadband capacity of approximately 3 + megabits per
second in an area extending to Jones Creek to the west, Tincap to the north and Maitland to
the east from DSL, wireless and cable. There may be some specific parts of the community
receiving up to 16 megabits/sec.

Brockville has 16 Gb/sec capacity for large corporate customers but a premium cost is
‘evident per month for this level of broadband service. Cost to ISP's average about $4000
per month per Gb to purchase broadband from national suppliers.

Brochiile broadband service providers include RipNet, Xplomet, Primus, Bell Canada,
Cogeco and MTS Allstream (formerly AT&T), with several fibre lines passing through the
community

‘The rural area outside the urban centres of Easter Ontario and Leeds and Grenville
average about 1.5 Mb/sec. Much of the rural areas of Leeds and Grenville are well serviced
with Internet connections of up to Smbs readily available.

‘The project could provide future access capacity needs for Brockville, the potential impact
fon ensuring competitive rate structure for broadband services to both residential and
corporate customers, indirect impacts associated with employment generation and business
‘expansion of our primary existing telecommunication firms and the general c)
‘marketing/promotional benefts positioning Eastem Ontario in the marketplace as the

largest and highest capacity regional broadband service in Canada. We would derive spin

off exposure from this market postion and the potential fr Industry prospect referas to the
community.

Conversely, the existing providers of broadband services to Brockville could also enhance
capacity competitive market rates to local residents.

‘Another variable is related to the proposed network being a closed loop system. The
Connection plans to both major interconnection sites in Montreal at CANix and Toronto at
151 Front Street are not known but would have a significant impact and advantage to our
local ISP's and any clients ofthe network.

‘The major unknown and reservation relates to the inability of the EOBN to confirm the
proposed rate structure and thus validating the competitive rate opportunity of the new
network. This will not likely be achieved untl the major contractor/backbone firm is
confirmed, the governance model is ratified and the details of the business and market
model are made public.

‘Tho Brockville telecommunication firms have invested already in this project and hope to
‘secure contracts to build components of the network. Significant additional investment will

cceur should the local fms secure some of the contracting projects. Tothe best of our @
knowledge this has not occurred but one RFP is under review from a local supplier.

Itis predicted by EOBN that its rate structure will be competitive for 10 Mb/sec service as of
2013. Wholesale rates for ISP's have not yet been determined

Broadband Initiative Report Budget Commitee Pages

Local jobs will only be created if local telecommunication firms are awarded contracts to
build, operate or maintain, in whole or in part, the transport or access network.

Reference to securing municipal contributions, most of the counties in Eastem Ontario have
‘committed $1million each to be expensed over a four years. Some municipalities have
‘committed support due to their regional/rural jurisdiction and the need to expand services to
meet basic service.

Quotes from other potential users of the system include:

Brockville General Hospital- Ray Marshall - No advantage to hospital envisioned as they
are connected to Ministry of Health system. Could be beneficial to the clinics and private

physician residences for file field transfers

Brockville Police -Tom Reil ~ Currently have capacity and see no need for service or
benefit to police directly

Brockville Chamber of Commerce- Have had no contact and as such, no opinion

‘There are no major capital plans identified by the national providers such as Bell and
Cogeco at this time. Bellis at capacity and Cogeco will likely be expanding their network

{In terms of the formula calculation on the requested contribution from Brockville, private
sector input confirms that the rate is fair and in the range of reasonableness based on
industry comparisons on the typical costing associated with establishing a POP site which
represents an allocation for transport, acoess and project management.

EOBN confirm that there is no further capital or operational financing request being
proposed by the municipalities

CONCLUSION

The Eastem Ontario Broadband Network will position the region favourably for investment
attraction and related employment opportunity, and represents a significant economic
‘development infrastructure for future prosperity. The network will be established with or
without a contribution from the City of Brockville. A financial commitment to the project
however, would demonstrate an inclusive partnership, and create a positive position in
‘negotiating future contracting by our local telecommunication firms. It would also ensure
‘maintaining good goverment relations with the development. oriented federal and
provincial ministries at such time Brockvile submits government funding applications for
‘economic development projects.

‘The project is considered lower on the priority scale based on other economic development
initiatives identified in the Brockville Economic Development Strategy approved by Council
in June 2010.

Eastem Independent Telecom did not secure contracts and state marginal supplier benefits
due to the awarding of the major contract to Bell Alliant who use extemal distributors outside
of Easter Ontario
