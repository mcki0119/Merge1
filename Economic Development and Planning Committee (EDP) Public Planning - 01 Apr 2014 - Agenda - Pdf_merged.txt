1m opposed tothe request for the change of zoning from 1 Single Unit Residential to R3 General
Residential as wellas to the request for Special Exception Zoning to allow forthe constuction of 2
semi-detached dwelling.
‘currently there are no semi-detached dwellings on the southside of King treet in this nity (Sabine
Road, Garke Crescent, Elzabeth Street, Bayview Avenue and Chipman Road )
Furthermore in a R3 Zone the minimum frontage for a semi-detached dwelling i 6 feet requiring 30
feet frontage for each unit
‘The owner does not have sufficient frontage fr such a project. The mass ofthe proposed project is
‘ot in keeping with the proportions ofthe neighboring homes.
‘The sketch of potential parking and ground floors Is vague at est and indicates no front entrances (or
‘any entrances) foreach proposed unit and leaves only garage doors facing the street.

‘This project wil negatively affect the property value of other homes Inthe area by changing the
landscape /streetscape of the community.

‘Asa last point, construction so cose to the sanitary easement may prove problematic and | would ike
‘tobe assured that the property owner would assume all esponsibility for any damages to this sanitary

Re: Elizabeth Street Brockville
File DI4-173,

Dear Sir

Please accept ths letter as our formal notice of opposition the proposed amendment
regarding a zoning change on Elizabeth Street. We feel this not the proper and best se of
the property, the parcel of land in question should be restricted to one single family
{dwelling as is every other property on the street. In addition to keeping new construction
in line with what exists already we have additional concems with parking issues that
‘would be created by adding two additional households. This winter really highlighted
how congested that corner can get and adding additional households beyond what is
approved now would be unwise. We also have concerns with the negative impact a
‘semi/row house would have on our property values as we have a significant investment at
stake here

Should you have any questions or if you need to speak with us please feel free to cal

[MPAC told me thatthe reason my property taxes are above average is because I live on the river

‘When I purchased my property in an RI zone a city representative assured me that RI was the

This is

The planned structure will il almost the entie width ofthe lot, and the Elizabeth St. side will be

Re: Elizabeth Street Brockville
File D14173

Dear Sir,

Please accep this letters our formal notice of opposition tothe proposed amendment regarding a
zoning change on Elizabeth Street.

Elizabeth Street isa quict subdivision consisting entirely of single-family dwellings. Most of the
residents of the strect are retired, or soon to be retired, people enjoying the peacefulness of atypical
Brockville neighbourhood.

‘To build a semi-detached row-house here would be detrimental tothe neighbourhood and to our
property values.

‘We built our home here on Elizabeth street, investing a Jot of our money, because it was a beautiful,
quiet, single-family dwelling area where we wanted to retire. We hope to stay here for a long time.

In addition to our opposition to a duplex, the sketches provided by the builder appear to show that
the front ofthe property would consist solely of two double garage doors and two driveways. This
kind of ugly row-house is used to fil in highly congested areas of large cities and is not suitable for
the area. Building it closer to the street, as proposed inthe zoning amendment, would make the ugly
building stand out even more,

1 don’t understand why the City of Brockville would even consider this zoning change which is far
outside the norm for this ares.

Should you have any questions or if you need to speak with us please feel fre to call.

Yours th

Dear Ms Merkley
We hereby wish to state our opposition to the proposed zoning amendment.

‘The inclusion of a semi-detached dwelling in the middle of an area with nothing but
single-family homes will reduce the property value of all properties in the

neighbourhood,

AA semi-detached residence will double the noise and traffic ofa single detached
residence

On street parking for visitors is already a problem on Elizabeth Street, impeding traffic
and interfering with snow removal operations in the winter. The proposed rezoning will
doubly increase this problem,

‘The subject property exists asa result of a previous rezoning amendment. The granting of
a further amendment would result in a gross exception tothe general zoning ofthe entire
local community.

‘This proposed construction with a frontage consisting of nothing but garage doors and.
two double-width driveways would not be in keeping with the character of the
neighbourhood,

We therefore object tothe proposed amendment.

Respectfully yours,

|'am writing to object to the proposed change to the above property from R 1 single unit
Residential to R 3 for the purpose of building 2 semi detached dwelling on the above lot.

‘The Lot in question is prime land with a view of the river. This is not the place to build a semi
detached dwelling in between other older detached homes on Elizabeth Street. There i plenty
‘of other vacant land in Brockville for the developer to build a semi-detached hame. The
‘developer bought the lot on Elizabeth Street knowing that it was zoned Ri single unit
