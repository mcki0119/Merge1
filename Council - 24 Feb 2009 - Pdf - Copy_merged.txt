NEW BUSINESS - REPORT FROM MEMBERS OF
COUNCIL

CITY WATER/SEWER RATES

Moved by: Councillor Noble

WHEREAS the waterisewer rate charge schedule for residential
usage is pemicious in that it rewards increased consumption
through quantity discounting at a time when itis desired to reduce
the load on the sewage treatment plant.

AND WHEREAS it would be preferable to incent conservation of
water rather than rewarding increased usage.

AND WHEREAS increased consumption of filtered chemically
treated water for summer lawn watering and car and premises
cleaning should not be at increasingly discounted rates,

AND WHEREAS lawn watering creates abnormally high
‘consumption which might be reduced if the rates are increased for
extra consumption and might eventually encourage some
residents to return to the storage of rain water and thereby reduce
peak flows in the sewer systems and peak pumping load at the
water ftration plant.

AND WHEREAS reducing consumption is a green initiative which
is in keeping with one of the stated priority goals in the developing
city vision and plans.

AND WHEREAS the less water that is used the less the energy
‘and chemical costs in pumping, treating and distributing and,
‘except for the water used for lawn watering, the load and operating
costs at the sewage treatment facil.

‘THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT staff will propose adjusted
waterisewer rate residential schedules designed to generate the
same total revenue but incent reduced consumption rather than
increased usage and such schedule to coincide with the Water
‘and Wastewater Service Delivery Review.

CARRIED AS AMENDED

‘SEASONAL CAMPSITES

Moved by: Councillor Noble

WHEREAS the city presently allows campsites to be rented for the
‘season on city islands and these sites are renewable by the same
individual for a total stay of up to 3 years:

AND WHEREAS there are few, if any municipal jurisdictions that
‘own adjacent islands which gives Brockville a significant tourism
‘edge if optimally utilized;

AND WHEREAS the city is creating a new waterfront plan of which
the islands are a significant part;

AND WHEREAS there are many ideas being formulated that
balance conservation with enjoyment and increased economic
benelit to Brockville:

AND WHEREAS giving 18 families a three year monopoly on such
‘a treasured resource is not good stewardship of this magnificent
community asset

AND WHEREAS the present policy of allowing a tenant to renew
twice will frustrate some initiatives for a period of years and federal
land provincial assistance funds are being focused on the next two
years:

AND WHEREAS there is a body of opinion that this legacy of our
ppast is no longer appropriate;

Page 18 of 23

City of Brockville

‘Council Meeting Minutes - February 24,
