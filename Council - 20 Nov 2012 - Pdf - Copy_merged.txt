STAFE REPORTS

2013 Budget
Review of Boards and Committees

Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority
Steve Knechtel

Mr. Knechtel offered an overview of his presentation. It was noted that this board has
‘come in with a 4.1% increase which is over the 2% goal set by Council. Mr. Knechtel
‘explained that Special Levy is the only number that could possibly be adjusted, but
that would just prolong these expenses.

Councilor Earle reminded Council that the Friends of the Mac Johnson Wildlife Area

do a tremendous amount of work as volunteers. Should the CRCA have to
compensate this group these numbers would be higher.

Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, November 20, 2012,

Brockville Police Services Board
Chief John Gardiner

Chief Gardiner reviewed his department's budget for Council. It was noted that the
increase of 7.2% is way above the 2% maximum. Most of the increase is due to
salaries and benefits and would be tough to mitigate. Chief Gardiner did explain that
there had been a part time civilian position removed after personnel were
redistributed.

‘Councilor Fullarton wondered why the budgeted revenue from Criminal Record
Checks wasn't higher. Chief Gardiner explained that this is always an unknown and
they would rather budget cautiously, than come in over budget.

During this discussion Chief Gardiner confirmed that the RCMP has confirmed nothing
will change in the CRC process regarding GPIC (Canadian Police Information Centre)
in 2013.

Airport Commission
Brian Williams & Valerie Harvey

Mr. Williams introduced himself and communicated that they are very pleased to offer
‘a reduction in their 2013 Budget.

‘Then Mr. Wiliams stated that they are hoping to start building the balance in the
Airports reserve fund, which is pretty much depleted. He added that due to the age of
the infrastructure, fuel systems etc. future maintenance will be required. They are
hoping to make an annual allocation of funds to this reserve that could be used to help
offset future expenses. Should this be Councils desire they would allocate $4,500
additional expense to the draft 2013 budget which would result in a net operating
budget of $88,562, therefore causing a .05% budget increase. Mr. Williams pointed
‘out that this would still be well below the maximum budget increase guideline of 226,

It was noted that this would become an incremental item in the Capital Budget.

Brockville Public Library Board
Linda Chadwick, CEO and Rick Sands, Treasurer

Mr. Sands introduced himself and explained since their 2013 Budget has met the
target there reason for coming tonight is to introduce Linda Chadwick the new Chief
Executive Officer to Council. Ms. Chadwick offered a brief biography of herself and
‘explained that her family is back in Brockville for good and plan on retiring here.
