PUBLIC MEETING UNDER THE ONTARIO BUILDING CODE ACT
() MEMORANDUM FROM
MAUREEN PASCOE MERKLEY, DIRECTOR OF PLANNING
2009 BUILDING FEES
Mayor Henderson announced the Public Meeting under the
‘Ontario Building Code Act.

Ms. Pascoe Merkley, Director of Planning, announced that Notice
of the Public Meeting conceming proposed Building Permit Fee
Schedule Revisions was given in the Recorder and Times
Newspaper on April 2nd, 2009, as well that a notice was sent 10
local builders.

Mayor Henderson called on the Director of Planning to explain the
Page 3 of 16

City of Brockville
Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, April 28", 2009

purpose of the Public Meeting and the nature of the proposed
Building Fee revisions.

Ms. Pascoe Merkley, Director of Planning reviewed the
regulations under the Ontario Building Code respecting tees
ccharged for building permits and the issuance thereot, and noted
that fees charged can only reflect the cost recovery of what it costs
to enforce the Building Code. Presently, the fees charged by the
City of Brockville only represent partial recovery of costs. She
noted that new fees are being proposed for the inspection of work
cried out without a permit and for re-inspections. The date that
the new by-law would take effect is May 1, 2009.

‘The following persons made oral representation with respect to
the proposed Building Fee changes:

Mr. Mike Veenstra, Spring Valley Homes, P.O. Box 1543,
Brockville, K6V 6E6, noted that last year, builders faced a 10%
increase with respect to building fees and are facing another 10%
increase this year. He further noted that the Building community is,
anticipating its worst year for construction and these proposed fee
increases are not good for the economy. He noted that the
proposed new re-inspection fees should be discussed with the
Director of Planning

Mayor Henderson asked the Director of Planning to explain the
proposed new re-inspection fees. Ms. Pascoe Merkley noted that
the construction of new homes would typically go through 5 to 6
different stages of construction and inspection and any one of
those stages could note deficiencies. If on re-inspection any of
those deficiencies noted were not rectified, the next time that a
Building Inspector is called out would be an additional fee. The
philosophy or essence behind ths is that i deficiencies are noted,
the next time around those deficiencies should be rectified
Failure to do this takes up our Building Inspectors time. We
ccharge a flat rate for construction of new dwellings and there would
be an additional charge if 3 or more inspections are required
The goal is not to charge more than our costs to enforce the
Building Code. We have provided estimates of revenues and
‘expenses however there is stil a net expense to the taxpayer.
When comparing Brockville to other municipalities, Brockville
ranks among the lowest fees charged in Ontario. This meeting is
to discuss if the proposed increases are substantiated with
respect to our costs.

Mr. Veenstra stated that another concern is the fee with the re-
inspection of grades and asked if this would be charged if the
builder was waiting for an inspection and discovered a problem,
Ms, Pascoe Merkley stated that when applications are submitted,
‘along with that application is a Lot Grading Plan and this must be

Page 4 of 16

City of Brockville
Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, April 28", 2009

reviewed with the City’s Engineering Division so that we are
aware of the grading as well as to ensure that there will be
consistency with overall grading schemes. At the time of
‘completion of construction, there is another steps to ensure that
{grading is finalized to a certain level of tolerance. There are times
when there are issues with grading and what the lot grading fee is
intended to do is to cut back on the number of times that staff are
having to carry out inspections to insure that there are not
drainage issues. There is no fee charged on the original
inspection. If there is the requirement for additional field checks,
then the fee applies.

Mr. Veenstra asked what would happen if the adjoining property
‘owner alters the grading plan. Ms. Pascoe Merkley noted that in
those cases, it is incumbent on the builder and the City's
Engineering staff to work together. The proposed new fees are
intended to correct the numerous times that staff are required 10
review and re-review the same issues. Mr. Veenstra asked, with
respect to the submission of plans to the Engineering Deparment
for approval on grading, is t acceptable to use a CET to review
the drawings. Ms. Pascoe Merkley stated that the City accepts
CETs, Ontario Land Surveyors or Professional Engineers. Mr.
Veenstra asked if a builder could eliminate one of the 5 steps,
would he receive a discount. Ms. Pascoe Merkley invited Mr.
Veenstra to share more of this idea with the Planning
Department. Mr. Veenstra questioned why City staff would require
cr insist on a soil inspection when his development is on bedrock.
Ms. Pascoe Merkley noted that inspectors must determine the
condition ofthe site prior to the issuance of a permit.

Mayor Henderson asked what the process is if there is a
disagreement between a builder and the City. Ms. Pascoe
Merkley noted that there is always the opportunity for dialogue
between the builder and staff and if there is a disagreement, the
builder may go to the Code’s Commission.

Mr. Veenstra noted that in the Downtown area, the City has a
‘Community Improvement Plan (CIP) in place that exempts those
properties of the requirement to pay the building permit foes and
development charges, however all builders are exposed to these
same economic issues. He stated that these fees should be
eliminated in order for builders to survive. He noted that some
municipalities have no development charges such as Cornwall
who now has a one milion dollar distribution centre being built
there. Council now has the opportunity to make an improvement
to the Brockville market.

Councillor Journal noted that Mr. Paul Veenstra of Coombe
Custom Homes has contacted him and requested that his issues
bbe expressed at this meeting since he was unable to attend, He

Page $ of 16

City of Brockville
Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, April 28", 2009

noted that the fees for a multi-esidential unit are going up to $950
per unit which, for a 50 unit building, would equate to $47,500.
‘There has not been a mult-residential unit bul in Brockville since
1992 due to these building fees. Mayor Henderson noted that this,
could have also been due to the tax ratio for a mult-residential
property being higher than that of a residential tax ratio, which
‘Council addressed last year by considering a new tax class ratio
called "new mult-residential” and its tax ratio is at 1 which is
‘equivalent to the residential tax ratio.

Councillor Baker noted that typically, a Public Meeting would be to
receive a report and review submissions. A report would then be
brought back to Council with staff recommendations to those
comments. He questioned where the time is for Council and staff
to reflect on these public comments if Council is being asked to
ppass the by-law tonight. He feels discouraged that we would ask
the public to come and provide submissions if our minds are
already made up. For clatity, Ms. Pascoe Merkley noted that the
{ee by-law before Council implements the 2009 Budget.

Staff was requested to report on the issues raised to the
Economie Development and Planning Committee Meeting
‘scheduled for May 5th, 2009.

‘The Public Meeting under the Ontario Building Code adjourned at
7:38 pm.
