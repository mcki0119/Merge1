RECOMMENDATION

‘THAT Report 2016-074-06 be received as information and that a report on this matter
be prepared by staff for consideration of the Economic Development Planning
Committee at a future meeting,

PURPOSE

‘To provide information for purposes of conducting a public meeting under the Planning
‘Act respecting an Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-
2014,

BACKGROUND

‘The owners of a small, vacant parcel of land, legally described as Part of Lot 4,
Registered Plan 80, being Parts 1, 2, and 3 on Reference Plan 28R-6942, City of
Brockville, County of Leeds, located on the south side of Bayview Road (private road),
hhave, through their agent, Mr. Michael Menard, filed applications for Consent to Sever
(File 802/16) and for amendment to Zoning By-law 050-2014 (File 014-012).

The entire property was acquired by the current owners in May 2006 as a waterfront
parcel together with a boat hoist and paved parking.

A portion of the lands (Parts 1 and 2 on Reference Plan 28R-6942) is proposed to be
added to the abutting property at 5 Bayview Road through the Application for Consent.
However, this action would lead to the creation of a remnant, undersized parcel (Part 3
‘on Reference Plan 28R-6942) approximately 84 sq. m. in area which does not conform
to the minimum lot size requirements established under City of Brockville Zoning By-law
050-2014,

‘Thus, concurrent with the application for Consent to Sever, the applicant has applied to
change the zoning on what is proposed to become the remnant portion of the owners’

CRCA Staff have no objection to the approval of Consent Application 802/16 and
Application for Zoning By-law Amendment D14-012 based on their consideration for
natural hazard, natural heritage, and water quality and quantity protection policies,

In response to contact made by a number of neighbours, there will be a review of
compliance matters with regards to the boat hoist location, Regardless, support for
the applications for Consent and Rezoning remain the same.

6. Neighbour

‘Submission received May 26, 2016. Background information provided respecting the
‘subject lands which were originally part of this neighbour's property. A right of access
was retained. Questions how the land could have been zoned residential. Objects to
the proposed by-law change as his view of the river would be blocked by a covered
structure such as a boathouse. Concems that his right of way to the river has not
and may not be respected. Photos were supplied.

7. Neighbour

Parts 1 and 2 should be completely de-linked. Proposal has considerable financial
implications to the owner of 5 Bayview Road. Rezoning of Part 3 will have
‘considerable consequences for the neighbourhood i.e. Bayview Road over which the
City of Brockville has absolutely no control,

8. Neighbour

‘Ownership of the property by a Bayview Road resident is desirable. The physical
dimensions of the property are not consistent with R2 zoning requirements and the
zoning needs to be changed to reflect the property use, Would be in favour of the
rezoning to OS Open Space with the removal of the clause permitting a boat launch
ramp, boathouse, unenclosed rooftop deck, boat port or boat slip, but would agree to
permit a dock with boat lit only

additional traffic. Concems with blockage of view of river, increased noise, parking
issues and loss of privacy. Some would favour “boat hoist only" or other compromise.
History of property provided. Uncertainty created by rezoning application. Approval
for boat hoist/platform may not have been obtained from CRCA. Concern with
blocked access to the river. Question necessity for zoning change.

Potential issues for Discussion:

1. Appropriateness of the requested zoning,
2. Consideration of potential limitations on zoning to address neighbourhood
concerns,

Hi Bayview is selling there has been a constant
stream of tire kickers and generally nosey people
coming and going.

The thought of a zoning change to this subject
property allowing a boathouse and roof deck ;
translation Party Palace would add to already
strained parking, noise, riverview blockages etc.

[Bayview would support an application for use
limited to a boat hoist but no other use. Its been
that way for 40 plus years and that use would be
acceptable.

I wonder since that has been the use over all these
years IS IT NECESSARY FOR A ZONING

CHANGE AT ALL! What about a grandfather
clause?

| would lke to ask to speak at the public meeting Tuesday June 7, 2016 at 6:00 pm.

‘The following is information that | have been told, encountered or researched and at the
{ime of this writing believe to be true and would like you to know as background
information before the meeting.

‘+ The above lot used to be part ofthe property offf2ayview Road. A past owner
severed the parts above so that he could bulld a boat hoist witha ramp
(Gangplank) leading out to it and have access to the river. He then sold the
Original parcel of land with the house, but retained the section referencod above
Bayviow Road had deeded access to the river.

+ This owner recognized thafffBaview had the right to access the river. (please
s0e attached letter). The hoist blocked one from doing 50 but the right of way
was nover en issue as the owners and residents off Bayview were always
allowed to go on, over and te up boats to the gangplank and boat hoist.

+ The present owners ofthe above referenced property know of the right of way
before they bought it. The fist ime I came to my property ator they had bought
it was mot with a work trailer parked over my deeded accoss and an owner
siting on a lawn chair reading on the access.

+ went toa lawyer and an official request by him was given to remove tho
blockages. | was tld not to touch the hoist so had no access tothe river so my
lawyer went ahead to try to resolve the issue to one that was fair fo me by issuing
2 statement of ciaim. One ofthe proposals made by them was to extend the |
hoist out by about 16 feet to the south. Emalls wore exchanged but no
agreement was over signed. I was assured that before anything could be done
all the proper permits would have to be done, authorities notified (MN) and all
residents affected would have to be consulted with

+ was absolutely shocked to got a phone call one morning thatthe hoist (now I
believe a deck) was being moved out tothe river and the gangplank extended.
Myself, the owner offBayview andlll Bayview had no idea that this was to
happen. I contacted the MNR, the CRCA, and the City of Brockville and all said it
was not their concern. I guess I now had some sort right of access tothe river,
but never agreed to by me.

Question:
How can ths tiny parcol of land severed off to have parking and access to a boat hoist
be zoned residential?


Page 19 of 80

‘As of now | object to the proposed by law change for the following reasons:

1) My viow of the river would be blocked by a covered structure such as a boat
house. As of right now I can see the river from my property.

2) On such a small piece of land and with myself having a six foot right of way,
structure such as a dock or boathouse and a boat tied to the side, I do not see
how my right of way to the river could be respected.

3) The present owners through their past actions have shown that my rights are not
cconsidered. | have included pictures of my access to the river around the hoist
and the way they presently maintain my deeded access to the water.

Dear Ms. Bagnel:

Re: Application for Consent BO2/16
‘Application for Zoning By-law Amendment D14-012 (050-2014)
Lot 16, Con. 1; § Bayview Road and Vacant Pareel East of § Bayview Road
‘Assessment Roll 080203005533300 & 080203005535200
City of Brockville
‘Waterboy: St. Lawrence River

Staff of the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) have reviewed the above-noted
applications for consent and zoning by-law amendment, and provide the following comments forthe
City of Brockville’s consid

Proposal
‘The propos involves the severance ofan approximately 110.7 m® portion of vacant land curently
sed for parking from an existing 195.4 m (approx) vacant lot and the addition of the severed
portion to an adjacent 1,104 m? (approx) residential lotto the south (5 Bayview Ra). The la to be
Fetained would be approximately 84.6 min size and would remain ints curen se

Te retained lot is also subject to @ proposed zoning amendment that seeks to change the subject
zoning from ‘R2-Single Detached Residential’ to sitespecifie “OS-Open Space’. The amendevent
will better reflect the use ofthis land as an undersized parcel with a shoreline access rightof-way and
‘marine facility (dock). The zoning change would limit the use to private marine facility with human
habitation prohibited.

‘These applications are mainly administrative in nature withthe intent being to formally join the land
to be severed to $ Bayview Road to allow continued parking use and also to rezone the retained land

Ms. Maprll (802/16 & 14-012)
May 20,2015,

Site Description
“The subject lands ate located between Bayview Road and the St. Lawrence River inthe west end of
the Cty of Brockville. The lot subject to the severance (adjacent to 5 Bayview Road) has roughly 13
'm of ffontage on the river. This lot is “L” shaped and consists of ssphalt and grass with outcropping,
bedrock. There isan existing dock on the lot and the parcel is subject to a right-of-way for shoreline
access. The lotto receive the adltion is currently developed with a single-family dwelling. Ths lot
is mainly exposed bedrock with a varied topography.

Discussion
‘The main interests of the CRCA jn this application are the avoidance of natural hazards (Nlooding,
erosion and ice damage) associsted with the St. Lawrence River and the protection of the water
‘quality and ecological integrity ofthe river and shoreline.

‘The CRCA regulates development and site alteration through our implementation of Ontario
Regulation 148/06: Development, Imerference with Wetlands & Alterations to Shorelines and
Warercourses for lands located within and adjacent to natural hazard areas.

‘The CRCA defines the extent of natural hazards associated with the St. Lawrence River shoreline as
the ‘regulatory Mood plain’ and the ‘erosion hazard limit. The extent ofthese hazard areas occupies
substantial portion ofthe subject lands, including the vacant lot and $ Bayview Road

Through O. Reg, 148/06, development is generally restricted within and adjacent tothe regulatory
flood plain and erosion hazard limit. We note however, thatthe existing development at the subject

lands, including the marine facility (dock) atthe vacant lot and the residential dwelling at S Bayview
Road, is compliant withthe CRCA’s regulatory requirements andlor is grandfathered duc tothe date
‘of construction,

Since the proposed consent application is intended to formally enlarge the existing residential lot in
‘order to allow parking and does not involve any new development on the subject lands, CRCA stat
do not anticipate new or exacerbated natural hazard risks. We note thatthe existing vacant lot is
heavily constrained and does not represent viable opportunities for inland development. The
proposed severance and lot addition will not change this situation.

‘Staff support the proposed zoning by-law amendment fiom a natural hazards and waterbody
protection perspective since the change to a site-specific Open Space zone will formally limit uses on
the retained parcel to those which itis suited for, specifically: shoreline access and marine fai
excluding human habitation

Recommendation
Saf have no objection to the approval of application for consent BO2/16 and application for zoning
by-law amendment D14-012 based on our consideration for natural hazard, natural heritage, and
Water quality and quantity protection policies,

Ontario Regulation 148/06
{As discussed, the CRCA has a Regulation controlling Development, Interference with Wetlands, and
Alterations 10 Shorelines and Watercourses (Ontario Regulation 148/06), made pursuant to Section
28 of the Conservation Authorities Act. Permission under Ontario Regulation 148/06 is required
from this office prior to development or site alteration on the subject lands (both $ Bayview Road

Fist of all thank you for your response to inquires last week

Inthe interim | have learned the folowing Everyone from Clty Hallo the applicants for zoning change agree the holst
has been moved anywhere from 20 ~30 feet out ito the river frm its previous position of 40-50 years.

"have learned from the zoning applicant that Ken Kehoe of Kehoe Marine Construction were the people who maved it.

| sent an Emallto them requesting information from them as to when it was moved, how fart was moved and papers
ving them the legal right to move it without proper notification (Neighbours et.)

| did explain your office contacted me lst week that you had no record of pplcatons/approvals for this work

{was at Cy Hall this Morning in Brockville and they told me as far as they were concerned the CRCA had no concerns re
the zoning change

tis close to Unanimous te objection to this zoning change bythe 13 residents on the street. Ihave signed objections
‘that Ihave obtained over the last week,

From: II (owner of 6 Bayview Ras)
| woul ke to ast speak atthe public meeting Tuesday June 7, 2016 at 6:00 pm

‘The following is information that l have been told, encountered or researched and at the
time of this writing believe to be true and would ke you to know as background
information before the meeting.

* The above lot used to be part ofthe property of 6 Bayview Road. A past owner
severed the parts above so that he could build a boat hoist with a ramp
(gangplank) leading out to it and have access to the river. He then sold the
Original parcel of land with the house, but retained the section referenced above,
6 Bayview Road had deeded acosss to the river.

+ This owner recognized that 6 Baview had the right to access the river. (please
‘see attached letter). The hoist blocked one from doing so but the right of way
was never an issue as the owners and residents of 6 Bayview were always
allowed to go on, over and tie up boats to the gangplank and boat hoist.

‘+ The present owners of the above referenced property knew of the right of way
before they bought it. The first time | came to my property aftr they had bought
it was met with a work traller parked over my deeded access and an owner
sitting on a lawn chair reading on the acoess.

‘+ | went to lawyer and an official request by him was given to remove the
blockages. | was told not to touch the hoist so | had no aovess to the river 80 my
lawyer went ahead to try to resolve the issue to one that was falr to me by issuing
a statement of claim. One of the proposals made by them was to extend the
hist out by about 15 feet to the south. Emails were exchanged but no
agreement was ever signed. | was assured that before anything could be done
all the proper permits would have to be done, authorities notified (MNR) and all
residents affected would have to be consulted with.

‘+ | was absolutely shocked to get a phone call one morning that the hoist (now I
believe a deck) was being moved out tothe river and the gangplank extended.
Mysolf, the owner of § Bayview and 4 Bayview had no idea that this was to
happen. | contacted the MNR, the CRCA, and the City of Brockville and all said it
‘was not their concern. | guess I now had some sort right of access to the river,
but never agreed to by me.

Question:

How can this tiny parcel of land severed off to have parking and access to a boat hoist
bbe zoned residential?


Page to 0

‘As of now I object to the proposed by law change for the following reasons:

1)_ My view of the river would be blocked by a covered structure such as a boat
house. As of right now | can see the river from my property.

2) On such a small piece of land and with myself having a six foot right of way, a
structure such as a dock or boathouse and a boat tied to the side, Ido not see
how my right of way to the river could be respected.

3) The present owners through their past actions have shown that my rights are not
‘considered. | have included pictures of my access to the river around the hoist
‘and the way they presently maintain my dooded access to the water.

‘Assuming the following provisos:

Notes for committee Perusal:

EE built the boat hoist several years ago

to access his island across from St. Lawrence Park. Since
donated by him to the City. In existence for 40 - 50 years as a
ramp to a mechanized boat hoist.

I personally have access to numerous Color & Black & white
photos of this property over the years

My Mother and Father purchased [JBayview Road in 1982.

My father has passed away but my mother still lives here 34
years later.

She will be 92 years of age this September and has a chair
lift at J Bayview.

We have arranged for her to move to Maitland to be near
my wife and our waterfront home, She will have everything
on 1 level.

As a consequence of this zoning application we are unable to
put her property on the market because of the uncertainty of
the outcome of this application, Buyers want to know what
that sign is all about.

After talking to the residents of Bayview Road I have found
unanimous objection to this zoning proposal from 11
Residents.

There are 14 Residents on the street and of the remaining
three I have been travelling in Europe
for weeks. Before leaving they said they were in opposition
to the proposal but were gone before they could sign.
Apparently they are to return home on the 5" of June and I
am sure, knowing them well, they will be attending the

meeting. EEE went away last week and he gave me

An email address to send to him, which I did but have not
received a reply.

The last residcn(: A of Bayview

Who recently purchased their home are apparently involved
in a proposed sale of the subject property when the zoning
issue is resolved. Interestingly, when he spoke to me last
week re: river property he said he only wanted the property
for a boat hoist for his 17’ fishing boat and that was all.

n Sunday May 29", 2016 at 9 AM I was approached by

ee of the owners of the subject property. He
knew I was talking to the residents on the road about their
concerns. I told him there is almost 100 % opposition to his
proposal. I told him that there were concerns about the list
of potential uses for the property with the new zoning. I told
him there was a concensus that could be possibly be reached
where the residents would have no objection to having the
property for a Boat Hoist use only. He did acknowledge he

is selling the property to EE ofl Bayview Road
I was a little taken back when he then stated he would agree
to having the proposal for Boat Hoist use ONLY and
agreeing to removing ALL OTHER USES from the
application for the zoning change. This would solve the
problem all around and the new owner of the boat hoist
would be a resident of the street, not as it is now with
ownership from outside Bayview Road.

[also told EE had been in touch with CRCA re the
moving of the boat hoist out further into the water. [have a
memorandum from the City dated March 14", 2006 re:
subject property that states bottom of page 2: Work in/Near
the St.Lawrence River: Approvals for work within or
adjacent to the limits of the St.Lawrence river require
appropriate approvals from governing agencies. The Start
point for such approvals is the Cataraqui Region
Consevation Authority (CRCA). The CRCA may be
contacted at 613-546-4228

This memorandum was from my real estate files when the
property was put on the market in 2006.

1 told EE that 1 contacted the CRCA and they checked
their records back to 2006 when he bought the property.

He took legal possession on April 6, 2006.

‘They have NO RECORD of application or approval for any
work or movement of the boat hoist from its then position.

HE told me they had contacted EEE Kehoe

Marine Construction/Lansdowne for moving the hoist
further out into the river and said to me I was welcome to
contact Kehoe which I said I would.

I phoned and emailed Kehoe on May 30", 2016 at 1:29 PM
(Emailed) but as of today 4 PM I have received no reply. I
attach copy of my email,

The movement of this boat hoist out into the river appears to
have further restricted my mothers access to the river (See
survey). This could be determined probably through a
survey which my mother feels she shouldn’t have to pay for
and the onus should be on the people who moved it to prove
it is not infringing on her river access.

Besides moving the boat hoist the present owners decided to
change its use from a boat hoist to a platform/deck which
appears longer and wider than the original structure. All
electrical connection to the shore and electrical panel have
been removed changing its initial use drastically.

1 am waiting for a response to my request re: movement of
hoist and also copies of approvals for change of use.

I feel the bottom line on this proposal is: Approve the use of
the property for a Boat Hoist ONLY

The question remains was it moved legally with all necessary
applications and approvals. If it wasn’t perhaps it should be
removed entirely.

The residents of Bayview Road are meeting next on
Saturday June 4".

This evening I spoke ton Toronto, Owner of fl

Bayview Road, who told me he will be bringing with him
historical information on this property. He will attend the
Saturday meeting.

Ihave many pictures, aerial views surveys which I would be

glad to share with the committee prior to or at the June 7"

meeting. I can be reached 2M (Cell) email
