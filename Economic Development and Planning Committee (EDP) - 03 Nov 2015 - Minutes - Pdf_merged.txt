Economic Development and Planning Committee (EDP) Committee Minutes -
Tuesday, November 03, 2015

Mr. Cosgrove offered some background on this report.

Councillor Kalivas spoke on behalf of the Twin Pad Committee stating that
they had chosen the Memorial Centre site as they felt it to be the most
economical and made sense geographically as well and the City currently
owns the land,

Mr. Cosgrove wanted to confirm that they are proposing two rinks with
maximum seating of 300 per pad. They are not planning on building another
Memorial Centre type facility.

Mayor Henderson offered that it is great to get people in the City for Braves
games, but they are in and back out after the conclusion of the game.
Hockey tournaments on the other hand bring people in for three day
weekends. They are a captive audience. They will be more likely to eat, shop
or even stay here if they are from out of town

Councillor Kalivas noted that the Twin Pad Committee is not committed to
the Memorial Centre property and would be willing have other locations
investigated by staff.
