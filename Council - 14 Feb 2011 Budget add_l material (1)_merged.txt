‘Service Delivery and Oraanizational Review

‘These organizations are advocating for an external review of Service Delivery and
Organizational Review.

‘While | am completely open to any and all external reviews of our service delivery and
‘organizational structure, it is my humble opinion that this exercise would be largely a
«duplication of effort with minimal resuts and would have a demoralizing impact on staff
‘morale. Additionally (1) work plans would have to be modified to reflect resources
Necessary to assist external consultants;

2 Economic Development Resources,

‘The Chamber believes that Council, in their 2011 Budget will have to look at a
substantial increase in the Economic Development Department budget to support
these initiatives. The increase may amount to over $100,000 depending on how
‘guickly Council wants to implement what is called for in the Strategic Plan.

While it is not directly part of the Budget, an analysis of the staff's activities
should be done. This analysis will highlight any activities presently being done
that are not directly in line with the Department's of City’s goals, and may
highlight duplication of efforts. The analysis may also show where there are
‘opportunites for others in the City to take over some of the tasks presently being
done by the Economic Development Department.

Response:
‘Agreed. The priontized recommendations of the Economic Development
‘Advisory Committee will be presented to the EDP Committee and Council in
March. At this stage, Mr. Paul has augmented his budget by $15,000 to
partially deal with these recommendations. Council has a variety of options
relating tothe funding of these initiatives including:

= Tax Rate

+ Strategic Initiative Funds $204,000

Fiscal Policy Reserve

‘As outlined in the 2010 Organizational Review, staff are in the process of
‘evaluating the consoldation of the Library, Museum and Arts Centre within the
Economic Development Department umbrella. In addtion, the promotion’andior
partnership with the MDC will evolve over time and be incorporated within this
‘same department. Staff are aware of the changes being envisioned and will
‘adjust Human Resources to meeting departmental work plans. and corporate
objectives.

3 Fiscal Policy Review

‘The Chamber is advocating that the Fiscal Policy Reserve be restored to $1
Million in 2011,

‘The 2011 budget includes $150,000 contribution to the Fiscal Policy Reser
Fund resulting in a forecasted year-end balance of $801,000. This amount is
‘subject to 2010 year end adjustments.

CCouncii has a number of options to augment the Fiscal Policy Reserve in 2011
= Tax Rate
+ Strategic Initiative Fund $204,000 transfer to Fiscal Policy Reserve
= Hydro One Fund Reserve transfer $500,000 to Fiscal Policy Reserve

Key considerations for the City of Brockville 2011 Budget

‘Submitted by: The Brockville and District Chamber of Commerce
— Advocacy Committee

(Over the last ten year, the Brockville and District Chamber of Commerce has taken a keen
interest in the City Budget process. Each year we have analyzed the Budget documents and
‘come up with, what we think, are valuable comments on the assumptions made inthe
Budget, observations, and recommendations for what is needed for both the immediste
‘wsation year and for the success of Brockville in the future. We have reviewed our
submissions and have found that there are some recurring themes and Key areas that need
‘more attention from Council

Before the Budget Document is released, we believe that the incoming Council should
provide some guidance to Staff to seriously adress the following key areas in the
reparation of the 2011 Budget. These areas include:

Service Delivery and Organizational Review
Resources for implementing Economic Development Initiatives
‘Addressing the Fisal Policy Reserve

‘Timeliness in meeting Council's Objectives and Targets

‘Service Delivery and Organizational Review

‘Asa background onthe Service Review, in 2002 the Chamber made a detailed presentation

‘Council asking them to establish “levels of service” i ine with efficiency,
effectiveness, and the costo the taxpayer to provide tha level of service. In our
presentations in 2003 and 2008 we followed up wit suggestions that Departments
benchmark themselves with other communities, tht they set targets out two or more years
1oeffect changes in ther operations, ad that ts Council that has the leadership roe in
preventing costs from growing in what we called “service creep". In 2006 we
recommended a service delivery review, with all options on the table including levels of
Service and altemative ways of delivering those services.

1n 2007, the Province developed a detailed template to help municipalities dill down,
suiciently to understand all aspects ofthe service they were providing, get tothe tue cost
‘ofthe service, make comparisons of best practices, and explore other ways of delivering
‘that particular service. The Chamber Studied this proces ad talked to other municipalities
that had started down the path ofa formalized Service Delivery Review. We endorsed this
template, and made two presentations to Council calling for both a Service Review and an
‘Operational Review, and explaining how important it was forthe City to hire outside help
to facilitate project that would involve every City employee to find out where the
inefficiencies ae, to get an open discussion on new ideas, and to get buy inon the
necessary changes that would come from the reviews.

“The Cty decided todo the Service Review internally andthe Chamber followed its
‘progress in 2008 and 2009. Our presentations to Council acknowledged that a great deal of
{data had been gathered and that there were savings found, but we stil believed that an

‘ouside consuikant and facilitator was necessary to get the costs under contro and to make
the changes needed in the Organization to make It more effective.

{nour presentation in 2010, we noted thatthe City had found some significant savings
‘through the Service Delivery Review bu that there was sill an increase in the cost of
‘operations from earlier years. We noted thatthe process had taken 3 years to achieve
results that might have been expected in finding the “the low hanging fruit” ina first round
‘of review. We emphasized that with operating cost continuing to rise, an outside
‘consultant, with a proper background inthis area would be abe to conduct the next round
ina imelie manner, and would be abe to find further savings and develop plans for
{farther seamlining ofthe organization. As well, th benefit of an outside consultant with a
‘esh approach would bein recognizing opportunities fr cost reduction by eliminating
<uplication oF combining resources across different departments.

Inthe recent election campaign, the Mayor proposed hiring an outside consultant. The
(Chamber believes that Couneil shouldbe looking fra consultant with a proven track.
record in service and organizational reviews. A consultant is needed that s skilled at both a
bbomom up approach working with all employees, and atop down approach in looking st
how an effective municipal organization has tobe structured, Council shouldbe prepared
to find the right person for his task even if there is 2 substantial costo this process.
Because there may be some significant changes to service levels, changes in how services
are delivered, and the changes in the City’s organization, this consultant must report
<irectly to all of Council ad not through the isternal sta, oF to any one individual.

‘Reonomie Development Resources

Inthe key area of having sufficient resources to implement economic development
‘programs, the Chamber has in the last eight years, has made the point that economic
‘evelopment isan investment, nota cost Because the economic development budget is
split into many areas such as advertising. travel, prospecting, conferences, and joint
Iniatives with other groups, Council has to see thatthe expenditures are balanced in each
tea in line with an overall direction forthe Department.

12009 the City launched is Strategic Plan and in March 2010 an Economic Development
Strategy was released as pat ofthe Oficial lan process. These two documents eal fora
‘numberof committees, with the expectation that there will be significant Economic
Department development activity needed to implement ther recommendations. While itis
planned to have local champions volunteer todo some of the work, there will til be very
large workload forthe Department in supporting the Committees. Just the organization,
‘coordination, and administration ofthe Committees will probably require a significant
‘amount of time from Staff. Even more Staff ime will be needed o implement their
recommendations of initiate projects (although probably a different skill et will be
required).

‘Council has developed and endorsed this approach to economic development, and in order
{ort to succeed: Council must suppor the committees’ recommendations with staff
resources and with fund. If this doesn't happea, ori takes too long to get projects
Iniiated, the committee members will lose interest andthe whole process wil stall or all
spat.

‘The Chamber believes that Council in their 2011 Budget, will have to look a a substantial
Increase in the Economic Development Department budget suppor these initiatives. The
‘increase may amount to over $100,000 depending on bow quickly Couneil wants to
Implement what is called for in the Swategc Pan.

‘While it s not directly part ofthe Budget, an analysis ofthe Staff's activities should be
one. This analysis will highlight any activities presently being done that are not directly in
line with the Deparment or City's goals, and may highlight duplication of efforts. The
snalyss may also show where there ae opportunities for others inthe City to takeover
Some ofthe tasks presently being done bythe Economic Development Department.

Fiscal Policy Reserve

In both our 2009 and 2010 submissions on the Budget, the Chamber addressed the status of
the Fiscal Policy Reserve wher It was well below the $1,000,000 level. In earlier years,
this reserve had grown toa much lager amount and Council had decided that a target of.
1,000, 00 was the appropriate amount 1 cover swings In support from the Provine, and
‘wrexpecied but necessary operating expenses. I loks ike there willbe a large defi in
2010 that will more than wipe out the Fiscal Policy Reserve. Fiscal responsibilty
‘necessitates restoring this back othe $1,000,000 level in 2011. The ity must also look at
its other reserves, and all of is financing policies to ensure tha there is ot huge tx
increas arising ffom some unexpected change in revenue or support. Council must look st
Joag-term requirements and resist the temptation to divert funds from reserves, in order to
achieve some arbitrary tax increase target

‘Timeliness in Meeting Councils Objectives and Targets

Inthe past four years, the City has dealt withthe details surrounding a very complex
downtown development. This project has consumed a huge amount of time of City Staff. In
‘addition, there was staf involved In supporting the consultants in developing the Oficial

Pian It seems that other initiatives were delayed ordi not get the Staff support tat they

should have ad, Couneil wil have to set clear objectives and milestones fthey want

follow their Strategic Plan, get grow, and get new jobs. While this is not necessarily part,
‘ofthe Budget, this is a good time to addres the timeliness in how targets and objective ae
‘met. To meet these targets there may additional costs, and more resources inthe form of|

‘consultants, part time workers, of contact workers that may be needed.

Moving forward

‘The Chamber i planing to make a submission a the Budget mectngs in January
February in the New Yeu. We commend Council for sting targets for Departments as
they prepare their individual Budgets so that thee isa good starting point forthe Budget
debates: We believe that these key areas have tobe addressed before the Budget is
presented, as they ar key tothe cost cutting the City needs todo to try and contain tax
Increases and to suppor the growth ialtiatves thatthe City wants to implement. This isa
‘new Council, andthe Chamber hopes that if these key areas are addressed, the City will

OCTOBER 26, 2010
REPORT TO COUNCIL — NOVEMBER 23, 2010

2010-145-11
CORPORATE SERVICE DELIVERY REVIEW BOB CASSELMAN

CITY MANAGER
RECOMMENDATION

THAT Council of the Corporation of the City of Brockville receive report 2010-145-11
Corporate Service Delivery Review for information purposes and direct that Council be
given annual status reports relative thereto.

PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this report is to provide Council with a summary of the Corporate
Service Delivery Review exercise and to recommend further steps in our ongoing
pursuit of best practices.

BACKGROUND

‘Sections 224 of the Municipal Act requires Council to:

Develop and evaluate the policies and programs of the municipality
* Determine which services the municipality provides

On April 24, 2007, Council adopted the approach to a Corporate Service Delivery
Review as outlined in Report 2007-009-04.

In 80 doing, the City Manager was directed to work with the various stakeholders and
‘spearhead the completion of the Services Delivery Review exercise.

‘The following proposed statement was developed to clarify Council
proceeding with a Corporate Service Delivery Review:

intentions for

“To systematically examine the City of Brockville’s existing service delivery and
develop options and strategies that will enable the City to match resources to
‘services in the immediate and long-term future.”

Report 2010-145-11
Corporate Service Review Page 2

‘Over the ensuing thirty (30) months, comprehensive Service Delivery Reviews were
completed for the following City departments/local Boards:

Finance, Poiice, Library, Clerks, Parking, Animal Control, Human Resources,
MIS, Fire, Operations, Winter Control, Water and Wastewater, Conventional’
Para Transit, Engineering, Museum, Planning, Parks & Recreation and
Economic Development

ANALYSIS.

To date, 287 recommendations have been presented to Council resulting in an
estimated operating efficiency of $2.3 milion (2008-13) representing approximately 8%
of the net annual tax levy.

Implementation of some of the Service Delivery Review recommendations are not
completed and will require further research (ERP System/Fire/Police Dispatch,
Inspection Tablets, Water Smart Meters) therefore the full benefit of the exercise is
unknown,

Schedule 1 provides a summary of Service Delivery Review recommendations including
their status and operational efficiencies gained.

Given the aforementioned, it is recommended Council be given annual status reports,
‘with respect to the implementation of each service delivery review.

‘CONCLUSION

The Service Delivery Review exercise has proven to be a success in finding operational
efficiencies. Staff should review service levels/organizational structure annually based

upon corporate needs and circumstances. Service Delivery Review should be viewed
{as a long-term program that will become an ongoing part of our organizational culture.
