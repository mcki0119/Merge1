MAYOR'S REMARKS

Mayor Henderson commended the Chamber of Commerce for a job well dane with
the Wine and Food Fair.

Mr. Curtis Law, Municipal Intern, was acknowledged for his dedication to the City of
Brackville over the past year. Mr. Law was involved in assisting each department on
‘a number of initialives and has been actively involved with the planning of the
Canada 554 Senior Games. The Mayor stated that ifthe work ethic and enthusiasm
shown by Mir. Law is an indication of the future staff, municipal government will be
well served. Mr. Law will be finishing his intership with the City of Brockuille on July
9, 2010.

Mayor Henderson commented on the trip to China as follows:

“Overall | believe the delegation to China was worthwhile and a good investment.
11am particularly conscious of the question of value and our ability to get concrete
results. We were able to initiate discussions in areas of tourism, education, and
‘manufacturing. We met with the principals of Canadian Solar, the company that
és in discussions with Upper Canada Solar to potentially supply solar panels and
equipment; we had a good meeting and a tour of their plant. Their biggest
business challenge, a challenge that we heard often in China, was turnover and
staff retention. There is considerable wage pressure in China and itis
encouraged by the government as they transition to an internal consumer driven
economy ~ this is good news for us as their economy continues to develop.
Education opportunities were apparent on a number of fronts with St Lawrence
Gaollege already having an active recruting program in China but the biggest and

Council - Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, June 29, 2010 Page 3

‘mast immediate positive was the meeting in Rockport the day after we returned ~
this meeting was with the head of Tourism in China, an appointed position, whom
we met with at the Mayors conference. Of 65 Mayors there, we were the only
ones to have a private meeting with him, and in turn, when he came to Canada to
be a part of the special agreement signing in Ottawa, he decided to target the
1000 Islands area for a meeting with over 50 Chinese Tourism Operators - along
with some 25 Chinese media covering the meeting ~ we could not buy that type
of tourism exposure - this alone would justify the trip.

On the trip we were treated royally most of the time, we travelled to 10 cities in

14 days with 4 plane trips and the balance by bus. We ate state dinners for lunch
and dinner mostly. It was extremely busy, very hot and muggy and quite a bit of
‘smog ~ the places we saw were booming with construction.

‘A forma report will be prepared forth July 2" Council Meeting.”
