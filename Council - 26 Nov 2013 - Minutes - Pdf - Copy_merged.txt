2. 2014 Budget - Council Queries

Councillor Baker confirmed that Chief Dwyre's report, provided with the agenda,
responds to the questions related to firetruck. He asked ifthe truck is currently used
ina backup role and would the new equipment go to front line and older equipment to
‘second line, Chief Dwyre confirmed that was the plan.

Councilor Beatty questioned if the maintenance program should be changed to avoid
corrosion in the future. Mr. Cosgrove confirmed that a rust proofing program was in
place but noted that over time water has penetrated the frame of the fire truck to
‘cause corrosion. There is nothing in our maintenance program that would have
prevented this type of problem.

Councilor Baker stated that he would still ike to see what demo models are available
to save costs.

provided

Carried

Mr. Casselman spoke to Councillor Beatty's query to reduce the budget by 1% to 2%.
He advised that his recommendations to reduce the budget by approximately $600,000
would include:

+ Reduce the proposed increase to capital budget by $300,000;
+ Defer allocation of $200,000 to fiscal policy reserve!

+ Eliminate/reduce Facade Improvement Pragram Grant - $80,000,
+ Increase building permit fees to the benchmarks - $20,000

Policy. With CPI estimated at 0.8%, he is of the opinion that a (minimum) 1.5% increase
{for non-union staf is not appropriate.
