2014-042-04
‘Transfer of Property from the Corporation ‘Sandra M. Seale
of the City of Brockville to Mr. William Ray Levia City Clerk
Application to Convert to Land Titlos (215 Park Street)

RECOMMENDED

‘THAT Council authorize transfer from the Corporation of the City of Brockville to Mr.
Wiliam Ray Levia a parcel of property being composed of Part of Lot 10, Concession 1,
Geographic Township of Elizabethtown (aka Butlers Creek) between Park & Ormond,
City of Brockville, designated as Part 2, Reference Plan 28R-14199, SAID PARCEL
being Part of PIN 44172-0212(R); and

‘THAT the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to execute all necessary documents to give
effect tothe intention thereof

PURPOSE

‘The request before Council is of a housekeeping nature and intended to correct a
transfer of property from Land Registry to Land Titles System,

BACKGROUND

‘The Clerk's Office is in receipt of request from Mr. Levia's Solicitor, Mr. Neville
Johnston, to facilitate this transfer in order for the Application to Covert the lands to
Land Titles to be completed.

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

In the late 2000's, the Province of Ontario completed the switch from land registry to the
Land Titles System, including the Leeds County Registry Office. Not all properties were
successfully transferred to the new system and from time to time transfers (to and from)
are required to clear up title on properties and enable registry in the Land Titles System,

‘The subject land is highlighted on the attached drawing, As you will note, the subject
parcel, the former Butler's Creek, bisects the subject property, dividing Mr. Levia's
property, leaving a wedge on the east side of the creek. The creek was rerouted many
years ago and no longer runs even close to the boundaries of the subject property. The
‘subject property may have been ownedirequited by the Corporation many years ago,
but would have been transferred many years ago under the former registry system.

‘The request was reviewed by the Planning, Operations and Environmental Services,
departments and no concems were noted
