Council Meeting Minutes - Tuesday, June 13, 2023

The Mayor noted that there have been a lot of conversations in the community
around waste and recycling, as our contractor has had to become a bit more
vigilant about the materials being picked up. He went on to explain that if there
is garbage in the recycling, the City faces issues, including higher costs and
recyclable’s being diverted to the landfill. Mayor Wren invited Peter Raabe, the
City’s Director of Engineering and Infrastructure, to provide an update to the
community.

Peter Raabe offered a review of the issues currently effecting the City's recycling
program. He explained that if there is garbage or non-recyciables in the
containers, the contractor's staff has been asked to leave that container at the
curb. He noted that if anyone has questions, they can check the City's website
regarding solid waste and recycling at this link https://brockville.com/city-
