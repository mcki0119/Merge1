actions & evaluation

Annual business plans & budget

+ Annual business plans dive further into our strategic
priorities by turning them into measurable actions
(action items).

Action items support one or more strategic priority and

support an annual theme that furthers the strategic plan.

+ Business plans are developed each year by Library staff
under the direction of the CEO and drive the annual
strategic budget.
