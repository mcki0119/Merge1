“Townhouse Dwelling, Street, means a townhouse dwelling on a separate lot and
having legal frontage on a public street.”

‘The request for this special exception zone is based on the lot dimensions, number of
units, the intended freehold tenure for the units and the need to add a "Street Townhouse
Dwelling” as a permitted use to the existing R3-General Residential Special Exception
Zone. in addition, the lot is an existing lot lying north of an existing unopened road
allowance created under the initial design for the adjacent easterly lands currently owned
by Junic Construction and formerly occupied by Philips Cables. The proposed street
townhouse will otherwise be consistent with those zone provisions set out under the R3-2-
General Residential, Special Exception, Zone. in particular, the four unit street townhouse
on Block 9 is to be severed into 4 separate holdings and all units are to face Centre Street.
Accordingly, only the north end unit will abut the rear yards of Pearl Street dwellings. This
‘unt will maintain the minimum side yard setback for new construction of not less than 1.2
metres. There is no encroachment into the adjoining rear yard of the dwelling located on
the West end of Pear! Street. The street townhouse format, including design, setbacks and

tent with those dwellings currently built within Centre Street-Phase | and is
it with good planning practice through the blending of dwelling types.

If supported, the proposed zoning for Block 9 would read similar to the following:
"6.3.4.2 R3-8 Zone (East side of Centre Street)

The uses permitted in the R3-2 Zone shall be those uses permitted in the R3 Zone
in addition to a Street Townhouse Dwelling.

The zone provisions for the R3-8 Zone shall be the R3-General Residential Zone
provisions save and except that the minimum front yard setback shall be 9.0
‘metres for all permitted uses.”

The proposed zoning is acceptable,

‘SAR = Butternut

‘On 13 June 2013, Oliver K. Reichl, BES (Honours), Butternut Assessor, issued a
letter in regard to his assessment of Butternut trees on the Centre Street-Phase Il
property. The letter was provided in its entirety to OMNRF for peer review. No
retainable trees were found on-site. Accordingly, SAR-Buttomut trees are not a
‘concern under SAR.

Based on the findings of the forgoing studies and peer review by OMNRF, the
matter of Species-at-Risk under The Endangered Species Act (ESA 2007) 5.0.

Site Contamination / Remediation:

‘The subject land was sampled as part of the Phase | and Phase Il Environmental
Site Assessments performed and assisted with the former Brockville McDowell
lands. In particular, a Phase Il ESA was undertaken as follows:

Aportion of the proposed subdivision lies within IPZ-2. The IPZ-2's defined by the
movement of water and is sized to encompass a two-hour time of travel for a
contaminant to reach the intake, as shown on Schedule “F” to this report. This
area is therefore subject to review under the Clean Water Act, 2008. To-date,
‘approvals have not been received but are under review. Accordingly, assessment
under the Clean Water Act, 2008, has been addressed as a condition of Draft plan
approval and to be included in the Subdivision Agreement.

6. Financial Assistance to Existing Residents to Connect to Municipal Services and
Requirement for Existing Residents to Connect to Municipal Services:

Residents questioned the availability of financial assistance to existing residents to
connect to municipal services. S. Allen, Supervisor of Engineering, by memo dated
12 February 2018 stated the following:

“We are not aware of any grant programs available for homeowners to connect 10
the new sewer stubs that will be installed to the property line by the City. Each
homeowner has the choice whether fo connect to the sewers or keep their existing
‘septic and sump-pump systems intact, thus experiencing no extra costs".

7. Servicing of Vacant Lands on the West Side of Centre Street:

‘The matter of “adequate sizing for sanitary and storm sewers to accommodate
future development of the acreage between the houses on the North end West side
of Centre Street and the Country Club” was brought forward by letter dated 10
December 2014 and submitted following the Public Meeting held on 02 December
2014.

The Environmental Services Department has confirmed that sizing of the sanitary
and storm sewers on Centre Street has been designed to municipal standards. As
there is no current plan under consideration for development of the vacant land,
noted in correspondence of 10 December 2014, the design and sizing of services
for said lands wil be the responsibilty of the future developer.

‘Street Phase |. Centre Street-Phase | is not part of the current application and is,
being addressed between the applicable parties.

Centre Street Phase I! has been designed such that all drainage is directed towards
Centre Street. The Environmental Services Department has confirmed that, based
‘on the design drawings submitted by Eastem Engineering Group Inc., there are no
drainage swales or drainage features located on Junic lands.

9. Lapsed Pian & Wording of Notice of Public Meeting

‘The matter of the status of the proposed subdivision, in terms of lapsing of the
previous Plan and wording used in the Notice of Public Meeting, was brought
forward by letter dated 10 December 2014 and submitted to the Planning
Department following the Public Meeting held on 02 December 2014.

The previous draft Plan lapsed on 24 June 2006 The Owner ofthe subject lands,
Rob Thompson, representing Brockville Centre Development Corporation, was
‘made aware of this situation and the options associated therewith, prio to lapsing of
the Draft approval. The Planning Act has no requirements for notification ofapsing
of a draft approval

The wording of the Public Notice for the current applications clearly stated the
purpose of the meeting, the legal description of the subject land and included a map
showing the subject land. The location of the north unopened road allowance is not
part of the current applications.

10. Walkway between Centre Street and Junic Lands:

The Cycing Advisory Committee Report, issued on 10 December 2012,
recommended a walkway connection between Centre Street and the Junic lands.
‘The suggested location was the south side of the unopened road allowance at the
north-west comer of the site. This would place it on the north side of Block 8

However, the preliminary plan for the Junic lands placed the walkway on the south
side of Block 1. This location is difficult to develop due to the rock outcrop and
{grade. Discussion is on-going between the two landowners, through their respective
Agents, to resolve the location of a connecting walkway. Accordingly, resolution of
this matter is addressed as a condition of Draft approval.

11. Sidewalk Location / Use of Boulevard / Sidewalk Cost:

Residents questioned the sidewalk location, use of the City boulevard and sidewalk
cost. S. Allen, Supervisor of Engineering, by memo dated 12 February 2015 stated
the following:

‘+ Sidewalk Location / Use of Boulevard:

“Final sidewalk locations and street alignment will be determined based on
‘proposed utility layout once provided by Hydro One. Due to existing utility poles
and swales the proposed sidewalk is located on the west side of Centre Street
{from Baxter Drive to the north end of Centre Street.”

“The developer is required to install new sidewalk in front of the new proposed
lots on the east side of Centre Street, from Baxter Drive to the proposed street
‘servicing the Junic property approximately 166 m northerly."

“The City isnot taking any addtional lands from what is presently owned on the
west side of Centre Street by the City. Should sidewalks be installed, they
would be placed within the existing standard right-of-way typical to anywhere
‘ise in the City.”

‘= Sidewalk Cost;

‘The developer is responsible for the cost for installation of all sidewalk fronting
the proposed development.

The City is responsible for all costs associated with other sidewalks to be
constructed as part of the reconstruction of Centre Street.

Mr. Allen also confirmed that “All design decisions made by the City have fo be
reviewed for safety, conformity, practicality and financial feasibility.”

side of Centre Street and crossing to the west side of Centre Street opposite Block
1 Phase Il. Each dweling is connected to the pole with an underground lead. The
pole line was not buried due to excessive relocation costs associated with the
blasting and removal of rock parallel to Centre Street

Electrical servicing details for Centre Street-Phase I! is currently under review by
Hydro One. Accordingly, resolution of this matter is addressed as a condition of
Draft approval

13. _ Compatibilty of Proposed Street Townhouse Use:

‘The subject land is currently zoned as R3-2-Genoral Residential, Special Exception
Zone which permits townhouse style dwellings, among others to be developed with
‘no amendment to the zoning. The proposed amendment would, if approved, be
applied to Block 9 only, and would maintain those zone provisions currently
‘dontified under the R3-2 Zone while adding “street townhouse dwelling” as a
permitted use to allow development of a larger existing lot for its highest and best
Use, The street townhouse format, including design, setbacks and access is,
consistent with those dwellings currently buit within Centre Street-Phase |. In
addition, the blending of townhouse dwellings, semi-detached dwellings and single
detached dwellings in a neighbourghood is good planning.

‘Accordingly, as the existing zone provisions would permit a three unit townhouse
and does not request any changes to the applicable zone provisions associated with
siting and building envelope, the proposed street townhouses composed of up to
four dwelling units as an added use remains compatible with the neighbourhood as
per the existing zoning,

Official Plan Considerations:

‘The subject lands are designated "Neighbourhood Area" with “Significant Woodland”
considerations under the Official Plan for the City of Brockville.

1) "Neighbourhood Area”:

‘The “Neighbourhood Area’ classification of land means that the predominant use of
land so designated shall be for a variety of residential dwelling types consistent with
various land use and built form policies identified under Policy 4.3.3. As the
proposed development retains the existing R3-2 Zone residential zoning while adding
an R3-8 Zone to Block 9 allowing “street townhouse dwelling” as an additional
permitted use, the proposed use of land is consistent with residential development
‘identified under the draft plan of subdivision. The proposal is consistent with the
Official Plan. Accordingly, no amendment is required to the Official Pian for the City
of Brockville.

li) “Significant Woodland”

portion of the site, being primarily at the north end ofthe site, is designated under
the Official Pian as being a "Significant Woodland” andis shown on Schedule “H to
this report. This designation was based on available Draft mapping provided by
OMNRF as determined by aerial photo interpretation. The significant woodland was
not confirmed by OMNRF on the ground at the time at which the Significant
Woodland Mapping was incorporated into the Official Plan. The following is a
‘summary of site inspections and investigations completed following approval of the
Official Plan on 09 February 2012.

‘On 16 December 2011, a “Tree Saving Plan for the Philips Cable Woodlot” was
prepared by Oliver K. Reichl, B.E.S (Hons), Consulting Arborist Ecologist, for Collet
Surveying Lid, a8 Agent for 6865852 Canada Inc. examining tree species
‘identification and butternut assessment to prepare preservation recommendations.
This study revealed that although 20 buttemut trees were identified, none were
determined to be genetically pure. Accordingly, these trees do not fall within
Provincial Species at Risk (SAR) legislation.

On 20 June 2012, a study titled “Evaluation of Significant Woodland” was prepared
by Muncaster Environmental Planning nc. and BoufinEnvronmental Constiing In
for Collet Surveying Ltd. as Agent for 6865852 Canada Inc. examining the
‘quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the existing woodland and associated
habitat flora and fauna.

Results of the above-noted study are summarized as follows:

‘The woodland should not be deemed significant;

‘The following best management practices are recommended:

‘+ The removal of trees should take place outside of the breeding bird window
(May 15° to July 15°) unless field survey is completed by a biologist no
‘earlier than 5 days prior to clearing to ensure no nesting activity is occurring;

* Clearly delineate the area to be cleared to prevent the loss of woody
‘vegetation not intended for remove

*  Utilze small machinery for the removal of woody vegetation and do not work
Under the drip line of trees not intended for removal. Do not work within 25
1m of butternut trees not intended for removal;

+ No stockpiling or infiling should occur within § m of the drip line of the
remaining woodland;

‘© Minimize topsoil removal within 5 m of the drip line of the remaining
‘woodland.

Section 1.5, 7. ofthe Official Pian states the following with regard to Natural Heritage
and Open Space features as identified under Schedule 3 to the Plan:

Part 1, Section 1.5, Sub-section 7.

“The boundaries of Natural Heritage and Open Space Features and
Constraints identified on Schedule 3 may be further refined through an
Environmental Impact Study (EIS). Where the general intent of the Plan is
‘maintained, and subject to approval by the MNR and the Conservation
‘Authority, minor adjustments to boundaries shall not necessitate an
‘amendment to this Plan.”

Based on the forgoing studies and peer review by the OMNRF, itis recommended
that the conditions of Draft Subdivision Approval include conditions addressing tree
preservation, protection and replacement plantings through best management
practices.

Planning Act Considerations:

The Planning Act, R.S.0. 1990, c.P.13, Section 51 (24) requires the approval authority
(Council) to consider the following:

"61(24) In considering a draft plan of subdivision, regard shall be had, among other
‘matters, to the health, safety, convenience, accessibility for persons with disabilities and
welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the municipality and

(a) The effect of development of the proposed subdivision on Matters of Provincial
Interest:

Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) Considerations:

‘The Provincial Policy Statement (P.P.S.) 2014, issued under authority of Subsection,
3(5) of the Planning Act R.S.O. 1990, and in effect at the time of the fling of the
‘subject Application is the relevant document to be considered respecting these
planning matters. The P.P.S. provides direction on matters of provincial interest
related to land use planning and development. In exercising their respective
authority on planning matters, decisions by both the Council of the Corporation of
the City of Brockville and the Ontario Municipal Board ‘shall be consistent with”
policy statements issued under the Act.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial
ferest. Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under
consideration, and thus, only those relevant portions willbe discussed in this report.

Part V, Section 1 is entitled “Building Strong Communities”. Section 1.1 focuses on
developing strong communities through managing and directing land use to achieve
cfficient development and land use pattems focusing growth within established
settlement areas to ensure that development occurs in areas which represent
logical expansion of existing public services facilities and infrastructure and which.
represent efficient use of land and resources.

Part V, Section 1.4 is entitled "Housing". Section 1.4 focuses on creating and
maintaining a full range of housing forms and densities designed to be affordable to
moderate and lower income households. This to be achieved in part through
residential intensification and cost effective development.

Part V, Section 1.6 Is entitled “Infrastructure and Public Service Facilities” and
promotes the optimization of municipal services and public health facilities as the
preferred form of servicing for settlement areas. Servicing addresses water,
‘sewage, transportation and infrastructure corridors and waste management.

Part V, Section 2 is entitled Wise Use and Management of Resources” and deals
with agricultural policies, mineral resources, natural hertage, water quantity and
‘quality and cultural heritage and archeological resources. The site is not an
agricultural site and no indication has been brought forward that the site is of
archeological or cultural significance.

Part V, Section 3 is entitled “Protecting Public Health and Safety’ and deals with
natural hazards and man-made hazards.

All of the above-noted directives found in Part V, Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the PPS
point towards support for the additional dwelling units which are being sought
through this request for draft plan approval. Specifically, the proposed development
is located on vacant lands within the settlement area of the City and utilizes
municipal servicing. In addition, reconstruction of Centre Street, north to Brock
Street, allows for the opportunity for existing dwellings to change from private well
{and septic to municipal servicing. Servicing will complete the looping between King
Street and Brock Street.

‘Access to the proposed subdivision is from Centre Street which is classified as an
arterial road and connects to King Street East to the south and Brock Street to the
north, The area is serviced by the Red Bus North route which provides access to
many parts of the City elther directly or via connection to other transit routes. The
proposed development is to be made up of nine (9) blocks to accommodate twenty-
‘wo (22) dwelling units consisting of one (1) single detached dwelling unit, eight (8)
semi-detached dwelling units, nine (9) triplex dwelling units and four (4) street
townhouse dwelling units - @ variety of housing styles which achieve cost-
effectiveness.

‘Accordingly, based on the fore-going assessment of applicable PPS policies and
‘assessment submitted by Jane Almond, acting as Agent for the Applicant, the
proposed Subdivision is consistent with the PPS.

(6) Whether the proposed subdivision is premature or in the public interest;

The proposed plan of subdivision is not premature and represents the logical
extension of residential development and reconstruction of Centre Street.
Reconstruction also provides opportunities for improved servicing and access to
existing dwellings in the neighbourhood. The proposed plan of subdivision isin the
public interest in that it represents development of new dwellings on a vacant parcel
Of land within an area identified for residential development within the City.

() Whether the plan conforms to the Official Plan and adjacent plans of subdivision, if
any;

‘The subject lands are designated as "Neighbourhood Area" under the Official Plan,
which identifies the area for residential development as proposed. The proposed
subdivision is in conformity with the existing Official Plan and is in general
‘conformity with the proposed residential development plan for the adjacent Junic
lands which is designated as "Neighbourhood Development Area’. In addition, the
development is compatible with existing residential development and reconstruction
of Centre Street and the extension of municipal services will provide opportunities
{for improvements to adjacent properties.

(The suitability ofthe land for the purposes for which its to be subdivided;

‘The sites located within an area of the City designated for residential development.
The site is generally consistent with surrounding lands although some degree of fill
and/or excavation will be required on various lots. Various easements will be
required to accommodate servicing within the subdivision.

The proposed plan of subdivision therefore represents suitable efficient, orderly
development of new residential dwelling types.

() The number, width, location and proposed grades and elevations of highways, and
the adequacy of them, and the highways linking the highways in the proposed
‘subdivision with the established highway system in the vicinity and the adequacy of
them;

No new street Is to be constructed as part of this development as the portion of

Centre Street fronting the proposed subdivision is an existing City owned and
maintained street linking to King Street West, an arterial road, to the south and
Brock Street, a collector road, to the north.

Reconstruction of the portion of Centre Street fronting Phase |-Centre Street
development was completed under a cost-sharing agreement between Brockville
Centre Development Corporation and the City. Similarly, that portion of Centre
Street fronting the proposed Phase l-Centre Street development is also to be
‘subject to reconstruction under a cost-sharing agreement with the City. Although the
terms and conditions of a cost sharing agreement have not been finalized, the cost
aring agreement shall be included as a condition under the proposed Subdivision
‘Agreement for Phase ll-Centre Street development. Included in this agreement will
bbe construction drawings detalling reconstruction of Centre Street from the current
north end of Phase I-Centre Street development reconstruction northerly to the
Intersection of Centre Street and Brock Street. Said construction drawings are
being prepared by Easter Engineering for review and approval by the City of,
Brockville to ensure consistency with Centre Street-Phase |, Brock Street, Baxter
Drive and the unopened road allowance to access the Junic lands.

Details of a cost sharing agreement shall be finalized prior to the matter being
returned to Council for Final approval.

No development of the existing unopened road allowance located between Block 8
and Block 9 on the draft plan is anticipated untl said road allowance is required for
‘development of the adjacent Junic lands. However, design for the reconstruction of
Centre Street shall ensure that access and grading is compatible with future
Construction of the north unopened road allowance,

(The dimensions and shapes of the proposed lots;

‘The dimensions, shapes and layout of the proposed lots, in the R3-2 Zone and the
proposed R3-8 Zone, are or will be in compliance with requirements under City of
Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 once amended in accordance with the

() The extent to which the plan's design optimizes the available supply, means of
supplying, efficient use and conservation of energy; and

‘The physical layout of the plan is such that servicing costs for the proposed dwelling
types and for street construction is optimized within the parameters of Zoning By-
law 050-2014, as amended, and represents a logical extension and improvement of
existing municipal services and infrastructure. Given the scale of the plan,
incorporating specific energy conservation features Is limited to efficient street
crientation, efficient extension and use of existing services and efficient building
construction. The Ontario Building Code, particularly now following amendments
brought forward under the Green Energy Act, includes extensive criteria for ensuring
‘energy efficiency in new construction. In addition, the Planning Report provided by
Jane Almond has confirmed that “The proposed build will be constructed to achieve
the Energy Star standard.”

(m) The interretationship between the design of the proposed plan of subdivision and
site plan control matters relating to any development on the land, ifthe land is also
located within site plan control area designated under subsection 41(2) ofthis Act.

However, only the 4 unit townhouse development proposal for Block 9 will be
Subject to Site Plan Approval.

Based upon a review of the proposed plan of subdivision in light ofthe criteria established
Under Section 51(24) of the Planning Act, the proposed plan of subdivision is consistent
with the Planning Act.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

The proposed rezoning of Block 9, R.P. 28R-12501 to R3-8 General Residential, Special
Exception, Zone to add “street townhouse dwelling’ as a permitted use in addition to all
other uses permitted within the R3-2-General Residential, Special Exception, Zone is

and represent Phase | and Ilof the Centre Steet subdivision. Dweling types currently
constructed tothe south are individually owned townhouses defined in zaning by-law 050-2014
triplex dwellings. Adjacent land uses are residential tothe north, west and south. To the east
lands are vacant at present but were the site of the Philips Cable Pant.

‘The lands are designated as Neighbourhood Area subject to Significant Woodlands and zoned
R3-2. The property enjoys frontage along Centre Steet considered to be an arterial road and
identitied as a potential neighbourhood cycling rout. The current zoning permits single, semi
detached, dup, link and triplex dweling types. In addition to an application for subdivision a
concurrent application for zoning amendment will be necessary in order o permit the
development ofthe subject lands as proposed.

[As indicated on the draft pan:

+ Block 1 as a single unit dwelling,

+ Blocks 2 to 5 are proposed to be developed as semi-detached units,

* Blocks 6, 7 and 8 are proposed to be tipex dwelings as defined in zoning by-law 050-2014

Section 1.0, Building Strong Heatly Communities drecs “land use to achieve efficient and
resilent development and land use patterns” in a sustainable fashion. Efficient land
evelopment isto be achieved by:

+ accommodating an appropriate range and mix of housing,
avoiding development which may cause environmental o public
+ promoting cost etfecve development patterns,
feneuring thatthe necessary infrastructure isin place,
* conservation of biodiversity

ath and safety concerns,

Growth and development is directed to existing settlement and urban areas and intensification is
encouraged. Development serviced by existing infrastructure forthe provision of water and
sewage services is preferred and stormwater management best practices is promoted.

‘The proposed development provides various densities of residential development that will be
serviced municipaly and has been considered when stormwater solutions were designed forthe
previous phases of the subdivision. The proposed development Is consistent with polices as
Cutined in section 1.0 ofthe Provincial Policy Statement 2014.

Section 2.0, Wise Use and Management of Resources, outines policies specially related to

encourages the provision of range of housing types and supports a variety of zoning standards.
Compatibility with the existing neighbourhood stock is encouraged. New neighbourhood
‘development shall occur next to existing ull up areas and shall consider compatible bul forms
{0 constructed housing character. The plan also considers market viability with regard tothe
numberof units proposed.

‘The development as proposed will resut in four diferent bulk forms, isthe extension of an
{xsting subdivision willbe designed to be compatible withthe current charactr ofthe

havo been studied and the environmental professionals have indicated there willbe no impact
‘onthe feature. The lands have also been visited atthe appropriate time of the year to determine
that there is no species a risk nor is there any habitat that requires protection. The
Environmental Impact Study had been included as pat ofthe development proposal package.

Given the foregoing, the proposal can be considered to comply wit the policies or goals that
exist within the Oficial Plan.

4.0 Zoning By-Law

‘The zoning curenty onthe subject lands is R3-2. The proposed development complies with the
zoning by-law with the exception of Block 8 where street townhouses (four units) wal be
<eveloped if approved. Zoning requested is fora special exception to the special exception
zone of R3-2 to FS-2-x to alow townhouse dwellings to be constructed.

‘The proposed lownhouse wil have an interior side yard of 1.5 metres, an exterior side yard of
45 metres, a front yard setback of 10 metres and a rear yard setback of 7.5 metres. The zoning
by-law currently permits a height of 10.5 metres and the proposed units will not excoed that
height. The driveway on the most southerty unit wil be located as a common driveway to
‘abuting unit so as not to impede the visibly langle. There is an accompanying Zoning By-law
‘Amendment application o allow for this form of residential use

[As previously indicated in this report (sections 2.0 and 3.0), the townhouses can be supported
by policies inthe Oficial Plan and can be deomed to be consistent with Provicial Policy.

‘The lands tothe south have been developed with 3 unit townhouses. The proposal isa logical
texiension ofthe existing streetscape and municipal services. Bath the province and the Cty

‘consider mixed density development, compatible form and infil tobe a priory and preferred. AS
‘such the proposed zoning amendment can be considered to meet the tests of ood planning.

5.0 Conclusion
‘The proposed development is an extension of an existing subdivision and the subject lands:

were previously daft approved although lapsed. The development is consistent withthe PPS
and complies wit the poicies of City’s Oficial Pan.

Mr. Baker, Chair, introduced the public meeting and read from the prepared required
comments.

‘Mr. Jonathan Faurschou, Planner I, announced that the Notice of Public Meeting
respecting the applications for Subdivision Approval and Zoning By-law Amendment
‘was advertised in the Brockville Recorder and Times Newspaper on October 30, 2014
‘and was circulated to property owners within 120.0 metres (400.0 ft.) of the subject
property. In addition, a sign was posted on the subject property advising that the lands
are the subject of an Application for Amendment to the City of Brockville Zoning By-law
(050-2014 and Application for Subdivision Approval

Councillor Baker, Chair, asked that any person wanting further notice of the passage of
the proposed amendment should give their fullname, address and postal code to the
‘Secretary prior to leaving the meeting.

Councillor Baker reviewed the procedures for the Public Meeting.

Mr. Faurschou provided an overview ofthe proposed zoning amendment and
subdivision and introduced and provided the Committee and Staff with comments from
the Operations Department dated November 27", 2014 and alleter from Ms. Debra
Belfie of D.G, Belfie Planning and Development Consulting Ltd., dated December 2,
2014. (attached)

‘The applicant Ms. Jane Almond offered a review of her presentation that spoke about
existing conditions and provided an overview of the project.

‘Mr. John Mackey is concemed about the future ofthe trees on lot number one. He really
does not want to see those trees cut down due to construction. He asked ifthe City has.
some type of by-law in place to ensure safety of the trees.

Mr. Faurschou replied thatthe City does not have such a by-law but that they do
encourage developers to save as many trees as possible andi they can't, they are
required to plant new ones.

Mr. Mackey also wondered if the services will be underground as he finds the above
‘ground polesiwires etc. unsightly. Mr. Faurschou said the services are preferred to be
underground where possible. The question will be examined by the Applicant, City and
Hydro One.

Mr. Mackey asked if there will be consideration given to the creek behind the lots and
the fact that during wet times of year, It can become swollen.

(Mr. Faurschou answered that drainage will be part ofthe plan of subdivision and will be
reviewed by Engineering down the road. Also CRCA (Cataraqui Region Conservation,
‘Authority is consulted during this process.

Mr. Mackey asked if there willbe right of ways to the backyards, The developer, Mr.
Rob Thompson confirmed that right-of-ways are required for all middle units.

Mr. Wiliam Watson asked if there was flexibility in the setbacks within the by-law in
order to make the streetscape more interesting.

Mr. Faurschou explained the City’s setbacks are typically 6 metres. However, inthis
case, the minimum front yard setback is 9.0 metres. Given the depth of the lots, there is
{an option for the developed to stagger units while maintaining the minimum 9.0 metre
‘setback. Mr. Thompson agreed to give this suggestion some consideration when
finalizing details

Mr. Larry Brennan explained that he has had trouble with a wet basement ever since
they began the Brock Street subdivision. He is hoping that the drainage issue will be
dealt with at this ime. Ms. Pascoe Merkley replied that they plan to improve Centre
Street in 2015and it should be resolved at that time. He also wondered if connections to
City sewer would be mad ble at that time, Ms. Pascoe Merkley offered that yes
this would be the case and this would be by choice of the homeowner as there will be a
Cost to the homeowner to hook up to the sewer.

Mr. Alan Lindsay wondered how they will manage building on Lot One as there is a
huge rock there. He hoped there would be no blasting as there has been blasting in the
past that has been detrimental to his home.

‘Mr. Thompson replied that the rock will present challenges but there will hopefully be
very litle jack hammering and no blasting.

Mr. Gerard Asbruek wondered ifthe right of way could be moved southerly to line up

with Baxter Drive. Mr. Thompson felt that this could pose a large problem as Baxter

Drive is directly across from the large rock on lot one. Mr. Thompson and Ms. Almond
‘and with Junie

Referring to Mr. Watson's comment on pedestrian access from Junic lands to Centre
Street, Ms. Belfe offered that her client, Junic, is interested in discussing the pathway
between the two properties and provided a signed original copy of the letter from D.G.
Beifie Planning and Development Consulting Ltd., dated December 2”, 2014. Mr.
‘Thompson and Ms. Almond stated that they would discuss the pathway location with
their engineer and with Juni.

‘Mr. Thompson confirmed they would be one level townhomes as were built in Phase 1
of Centre Street

Heather Watson asked if they could install speed bumps when rebuilding Centre Street.
She added that people drive very fast on this road and itis used by many pedestrians,
both young and old

Councillor Baker replied that the Operations Department is not in favour of speed
bumps as they are very hard to manage when plowing snow. In addition speed bumps
‘are generally only used on private property. He added that there are other ways to
reduce the speed of traffic.

‘Councillor Bursey said that this was an issue in that area when he was canvassing. He
had spoken with Conal Cosgrove, Director of Operations, and he was going to look into
having some additional signage posted in this area,

Mr. Kevan Wiliams wondered ifthe reconstruction of Centre Street would proceed
regardless of whether this subdivision was approved. Mrs. Pascoe Merkley confirmed
that the road construction is planned to go ahead whether the subdivision does or not.
Councillor Baker indicated that this matter will be considered by the Economic
Development and Planning Committee at a future meeting, which will make a
recommendation to Council

‘The meeting adjourned at 6:51 pm

The Request for Information Sheets are on fie in the Clerk’s Office.

Site Deseription

‘The subject property is approximately 1.04 he in size, and is currently vacant. Adjacent lands to
‘he north, west and south consist of established residential properties; bordering lands to the east
are currently vacant but are identified as previously containing industrial development (Philip
Cable Plant). The topography of the site is gently sloping from northwest fo southwest and the
landscape consists of mature forest and associated undergrowth.

The property is designated ‘Neighborhood Area’ and ‘Significant Woodland’ in the City of
Brockville Oficial Plan, and is zoned ‘General Residential ~ R3-2” in Zoning By.

‘Summary of Proposal

Currently being proposed is a second phase of the Centre Street residential development,
sonsistng of the addition of residential lots on the eastside of Centre Street (on a portion of the
Phillips Cables property). Specifically, the proposal involves the subdivision ofthe existing 1.04
ba property into 9 residential blocks totaling up to 22 dwelling units. Dwelling types proposed
include a mix of single detached (1), semi-detached (8), triplex (9) and townhouse (4) dwelling
units. Proposed access would be provided via Centre Street.

Discussion

‘The main interests ofthe CRCA in these applications are the provision of adequate stormwater
‘management and sediment and erosion controls and the preservation and protection of natural

Ieritage features.

‘Stommuater Management

Existing. homes on the west side of Centre Street currently have no sanitary or storm water
servicing, Sanitary and storm sewers are proposed to service both the proposed aad existing lots.
‘The proposed storm sewer will outlet to the existing sewers on Pearl Street und Brock Street to
the north, These storm sewers are tributary to Buells Creek, Generally we recommend that
drainage boundaries be maintained and quantity controls be considered to mitigate potential
impacts downstream, The proposed development will ikely result in increased runoff to Buells
Creek. We recommend that Pre and past-development drainage areas, direction, runoff
coefficients, and flows rates be determined and submitted for review.

Since cumulative impacts are a concern, it is important thet potential impact to Bulls Creek be
{quantified so thet mitigation measures can be implemented iwhere necessary. It appears that
accommodation is being made between proposed lots 8 and 9 for Future access to the Philips
Cables property from Centre Street. Pethaps thee is opportunity to run stomnwater sewers from
Centre Street through here, ultimately discharging to the St. Lawrence River. This could address
oncers surrounding potential increase in flow to Buells Creek, A stormwater management
plan fr the ture development of Phillips Cables property would be help when planning such
details,

Quantity Control

ln general quantity control to pre-development levels for 2 through 00-year event storms is
‘required, unless it can be shown that downstream flooding & erosion is aot « concem (e.g,
Uischarging directly to a large body of water such as Lake Ontario), We recommend that ths Be

addressed.

Quality Control
In general quality control to atleast normal levels (70% longe-term suspended solids removal is
required unless discharging to more environmentally-sensitive waterbodies or source protection
areas (e.g. Intake Protection Zones) that require more stringent protection. WWe recommend that
this be addressed.

Additional Discussion

‘A 2012 application for Draft Plan of Subdivision Approval for 414 dwelling units on the 24.7 ha
Phillips Cables property (for which we recommended a stormwater management report be
completed) suggests further redevelopment is likely imminent. We contiaue to recommend that
4 comprehensive plan for stormwater management be prepared for the entice Phillipe Cables
broperty that addresses our concerns, including the use and protection of a low area on the
Phillips Cables property. This area, if used for stormwater control of Centre Street, should be
protected and maintained (stormwater easement) during future development.

‘Natural Henitage

Significant Woodlands

AS apart ofthe subdivision review process, CRCA staff reviewed the Evaluation of Significant
Woodland (Bowfin, 2012). Staff found the report’s methodology for assessing the woodlends on
the subject property tobe appropriate and the findings and recommendations tobe satisfactory,

‘Species at Risk
A Butternut Health Assessment was conducted by Oliver Reichl on June 13, 2013 as individual
butternut trees were located on the property. Staff recommend that the proponent provide the
City of Brockville and the CRCA with confirmation from Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
and Forestry that requirements under the Endangered Species Act have beca met
Recommendation

Staff recommend deferal ofthe application for Subdivision Approval (OBT-14502) and Zoning
By-Law (14-002) until such time that;

4) The issue of adequate quantity and quality control is addressed tothe satisfaction of the
CRCA and City of Brockville.

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS
Provincial Policy Statement Considerations:

‘The Provincial Policy Statement 2014 (PPS) issued under section 3 of the Planning Act
provides policy direction on matters of Provincial interest related to land use pianning
and development. Section 3 of the Planning Act further directs that Council decisions
affecting planning matters “shall be consistent with” the Provincial Policy Statement.

Part V of the PPS sets out various policies which describe the areas of Provincial
interest. Not all policies in the PPS are relevant to the planning matter under
‘consideration, and thus, only those relevant portions will be referenced below.

From a review of the PPS, there are some relevant statements/policies under Part V,
Section 1 “Building Strong Communities". The preamble in this section is a general
‘statement which reads, in part, as follows:

"Ontario's long-term prosperity, environmental health and social well-being
depend on wisely managing change and promoting efficient land use and
development pattems. Efficient land use and development pattems
‘support strong, livable and healthy communities, protect the environment
‘and public health and safety, and facilitate economic growth.”

This general statement is followed by more specific policies relevant to this application
for Zoning By-law amendment:

Section 1.1 Managing and Directing Land use to Achieve Efficient and Resilient
Development and Land use Patterns, includes various policies addressing sustaining
“healthy, livable and safe communities” through developmentiredevelopment within
settlement areas which build upon existing services and amenities.

Section 1.1.3 Settlement Areas, includes such policies as 1.1.32 “land use patterns
within settlement areas shall be based on:
) a range of uses and opportunities for intensification and redevelopment in
‘accordance with the criteria in policy 1.1.3.3, where this can be
accommodated.”

Furthermore, Section 1.1.3.3 also states that “Planning Authorities shall identify and
‘promote opportunities for intensification and redevelopment where this can be
‘accommodated taking into account existing building stock or areas, including brownfield
sites, and the availablity of suitable existing or planned infrastructure and public service
facilities required to accommodate projected needs”. Additional policies addressing the
‘matter of intensification are found throughout the PPS.

Section 1.4 Housing, Subsection 3, states, among others, that “Planning authorities
shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing types and densities to meet
Projected requirements of current and future residents of the regional market area by:

b) permitting and facilitating:
1. all forms of housing required to meet the social, health and well-being
requirements of current and future residents, including special needs
requirements; and,
2. all forms of residential intensification, including second units, and
redevelopment in accordance with policy 1.1.3.
) promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources,
infrastructure and public service facilties, and support the use of active
transportation and transit in areas where it exists or is to be developed;
and
establishing development standards for residential intensification,
redevelopment and new residential development which minimize the cost
of housing and facilitate compact form, while maintaining appropriate
levels of public health and safety.”

‘Section 1.6 - Infrastructure and Public Service Facilities addresses the efficient planning
land use of existing and future infrastructure, including municipal servicing, to ensure
logical and planned development,

‘This proposed development, requiring an amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-
law 050-2014, is a prime example of residential intensification within an older area of
‘our community and would provide additional housing opportunities. In addition, the

proposal is utlizing existing building stock, municipal infrastructure and is within close
proximity to recreational opportunities and public transi, and is therefore consistent with
Policies contained within the PPS 2014.

Oficial Plan Considerations

‘The Official Plan provides guidance on how to manage future growth, development, and
change within the City of Brockville.

‘The Official Plan's goals are to create a sustainable City in terms of health and vitality,
that is economically viable and diverse, has high quality municipal services and
‘amenities, and is well planned,

Section 1.3 10) states that “this plan promotes the maintenance, improvement and
conservation of the cultural heritage resources of the Downtown and Central Waterfront
‘Area and the City’s main streets as the predominant social, cultural and community
focuses of the City. This Plan further promotes these areas as unique mixed
commercial, office, residential areas that act as commercial, cultural, recreational and
entertainment focal points of the City.”

Section 1.3 14) states that “this Plan protects Brockvile's cultural heritage through
policies designed to maintain and enhance the City's built form heritage resources,
scenic landscapes and unique character.

‘The above policies relating to cultural heritage help to reiterate the Importance of our
heritage resources and the need to promote mixed-uses in our Downtown and Central
Waterfront Area. 22 Perth Street has been identified by Heritage Brockville as being of
“historical interest", but is not designated, being the former "Rock School House’,
‘Accordingly, the historic value of the building needs to be considered. The application
does not identify any changes to the exterior of the building.

Section 2.3 outlines strategic planning themes which include “A Sustainable, Healthy,
‘and Vital City’, “An Economically Strong and Diverse City’, “A High Quality of City
Services and Amenities", and "A Well-Planned Responsive City’. Specifically, “A
‘Sustainable, Healthy, and Vital City” outlines among others, that the City is to “ensure
that ail citizens have, equitable, accessible, affordable, energy efficient housing choices,
which are supportive of a variety of lifestyles at various stages of life.

‘Through approved objectives, the City is also to “revitalize the Downtown and Central
Waterfront Area as mixed commercial, residential, cultural, social, tourism and
entertainment destinations, while recognizing and conserving ts cultural heritage
resources’ and “provide for a vatiety of housing forms, tenures and levels of affordability
through development, redevelopment, intensification and infiling projects.”

‘The subject property is designated under Schedule 1 - City Structure, of the Official
Pian, as “Downtown and Central Waterfront Area within the Mixed Use Node’. In
addition, the subject propery is subject to the folowing constraints and considerations:

+ Schedule 2 - Design Strategy ~ Downtown and Central Waterfront Area, of tho
Official Plan, identifies the subject land as being subject to Policy 4.23.
Specfically, the property is subject to policies pertaining to the “Transitional
Area" and “Intermittent Street Frontage’. Policy 42.3 is discussed further in this
report.

Section 3 addresses building a healthy and sustainable City. Through Policy 3.2.2
Which describes the City Structure, itis noted that the City should direct opportunities for
Intensification and infil to Mixed Use Nodes and Corridors.

Section 3.5.1.2 provides information relating to affordable housing. This section states
‘among others, that it shall be the policy of the City that housing be affordable and
accessible to low and moderate income households, increase residential densities in
‘appropriate locations, and provide for redevelopment and residential intensification,
where practical. This includes the redevelopment of existing single-use and
underutilized areas with full municipal services, especially where the land is in close
proximity to human services.

‘The City shall also develop zoning provisions that are sufficiently flexible to permit a
broad and varied range of housing forms, types, sizes and tenures, and are encouraged
to provide opportunities for more affordable housing to be provided in the Downtown
and Central Waterfront Area.

Section 42 of the Official Plan contains various policies applicable to the “Downtown
‘and Central Waterfront Area". Section 4.2.2, Permitted Uses, states among others that
"Subject to the Land Use and Bui Form policies of Section 4.2.3, the following
uses shall assist in guiding the broad range of development permitted within the
Downtown and Central Waterfront Area’, as. identified on Schedule 1,
recognizing that a more definitive list shall be provided in the Zoning By-law.
41. Existing low-density residential uses legally existing on the date of
adoption of this Plan shall be permitted.
2. Medium and High density residential uses shall be permitted including
triplex dwellings, fourplex dwellings, row or block townhouse dwellings,
‘converted dwellings containing more than two dwelling units, small-scale
‘apartments, low-rise and high-rise apartment buildings; apartment hotels;
mmultiple-attached dwellings and other similar medium and high profile
residential buildings.
3. Residential units above ground-floor commercial uses shall be permitted.”

Section 42.3, subsection 11, states that for lands “Within transtional areas of the
Downtown and Central Watortront Area identifed on Schedule 2, the height, density
and massing of the development shall be compatible with the adjacent low density
residential uses through the use of appropriate transitions including but not limited to
lower building heights, additional setbacks and buffers, building treatments, location of
parking, and landscaping’.

Based on policies above, review of “Schedule 1 — City Structure” and “Schedule 2 -
Design Strategy ~ Downtown and Central Waterfront’ as well as comments received,
Planning staff are of the opinion that the proposal to permit the conversion of the ground
floor commercial space to permit residential occupancy will have litle to no impact on
abutting properties. The proposed amendment will also allow the owner of the property
10 convert back to a commercial use on the main floor should they wish.

By providing the option of residential or commercial uses to occupy the space, this
would offer a smooth transition from the contral core commercial area (south) to the
‘neighbouring residential areas (north and west).

Zoning By-aw Considerations:

The current zoning on the property with municipal address 22 Perth Street is MD ~
Mixed Use Downtown Zone under Cty of Brockvile Zoning By-law 050-2014. The
requested amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 would, if approved,
rezone the subject lands to MD — Mixed Use Downtown Special Exception Zone to

permit the ground floor commercial space to be used for residential occupancy, in
‘addition to all other uses permitted within the MD ~ Mixed Use Downtown Zone.

‘A review of parking standards was conducted for the proposed change. As the site
contains three (3) parking spaces on-site and an easement for an addition three (3)
spaces on the abutting site (directly south), no additional parking is required for the
proposed conversion.

‘Should the recommendation above be accepted by Council, the zone would read similar
to the following:

"MD-16 (22 Perth Street)

The uses permitted in the MD-16 Zone shall be those uses permitted
within the MD ~ Mixed Use Downtown Zone. — Furthermore,
notwithstanding Subsection 3.6, an apartment unit is @ permitted use
‘on the first storey.”

POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

‘A review of relevant policies in the PPS and Official Plan has been conducted as noted
previously in this report.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

‘A complete application for amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 has
been received, including all applicable fees. All costs associated with the requested
Zoning By-law Amendment are the responsibilty of the Owner.

CONCLUSION

Following review of the PPS, the Official Plan, Zoning By-law 050-2014, as woll a
submissions received respecting the request for Zoning By-law amendment for 22 Perth
Street, itis reasonable to create a site specific zone for the subject property to intensify,
utilize existing services/infrastructure, retain the heritage nature of the existing Perth
Street frontage of the building and’ to provide a mix of housing types within the
Downtown and Central Waterfront Area within the City of Brockville,

‘Accordingly, it is reasonable to amend City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014
whereby the subject land would be rezoned from MD - Mixed Use Downtown Zone to
MD ~ Mixed Use Downtown Special Exception Zone. This is reflected in the
recommendations at the beginning ofthis report,

RECOMMENDATION:

‘THAT Part Lot 4 and Lot 135, Registered Pian 375, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, be
deemed not registered.

ORIGIN:
On 23 February 2015, Wilson/Evely, acting on behalf of 653973 Ontario Ltd., Mr. J
Malovic, requested that various lots within Registered Plan 375, known as "Bridlewood
Subdivision” be deemed not registered. The letter of request, dated 23 February 2015,
hhas been attached as Schedule “A” to this report.

‘The lots which are the subject ofthis request are described as follows:

‘+ Part Lot 4, located on the south side of Fitzsimmons Drive; and
‘© Lot 135, located on the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive.

‘The subject lots are identified in yellow on Schedule “B" to this report.

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS:

‘The Ontario Planning Act, 1990, c.P. 13, Section 50. (4), addresses the matter of the
designation of a plan or subdivision or part thereof as not being deemed registered as
follows:

°60 (4) The council of a local municipality may by by-law designate any
plan of subdivision, or part thereof, that has been registered for eight years
‘or more, which shall be deemed not to be a registered plan of subdivision
{for the purposes of subsection (3). R.S.0, 1990, c. P.13, 8. 50 (4).”

‘The underlying registered plan of subdivision for the lands subject to this application was
created in 1981, and is subject to a Subdivision Agreement between Dodge and Dodge
Corporation Limited and the Corporation of the City of Brockville authorized by By-law

234-81. This Agreement has been the subject of various amendments through the years,
which have addressed the on-going development of various phases of the subdivision
and change of ownership from Dodge and Dodge Corporation Limited to 653973 Ontario
Ltd. Accordingly, the plan of subdivision exceeds the required minimum of eight (8) years.
to permit a portion of the subdivision to be considered as not being registered.

(On 30 January 2014, the Planning Department received a request for various lots to be
deemed not to be registered. This request was successful and was enabled through
By-law 024-2014.

(On 23 February 2015, the Planning Department received a further request for various lots
tobe deemed notto be registered. These lots have been determined by the developer to
be beyond the scope of his planned development at this time. In discussions with
Planning Department staff, Mr. J. Malovic has expressed his concem with the on-going
property tax burden from carrying certain lots in Bridlewood Subdivision which have no
foreseeable development potential.

‘The lots which have been requested to be deemed not to be registered are described and
located as follows:

‘+ Part Lot 4, located on the south side of Fitzsimmons Drive; and
‘© Lot 136, located on the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive.

Part Lot 4, Plan 375 is located on the south side of Fitzsimmons Drive and is a remnant
undersized and unserviced lot from the request made and approved under By-law
024-2014 and represents a housekeeping matter.

Lot 135, located on the north side of Fitzsimmons Drive, is an unserviced lot on the west
end of Fitzsimmons Drive.

(E-mail dated 02 March 2015)

“we are not opposed to the application”.
Mr. J. Malovic has acknowledged that he understands that should the lots which are the

Subject ofthis application be deemed to be not part of Plan 375, all future development of
these lands will require an application for subdivision approval, including all drawings,

associated fees and studies applicable under legislation in place at the time of
application,

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

The Official Pian forthe City of Brockville, Policy 6.4.5.1.14., addresses the matter of
deeming lots nat to be registered as follows:

“14, The City may consider passing a By-law under the provisions of the
Planning Act deeming old registered, undeveloped plans which are
‘inadequate due to matters such as lot size, unsuitable access or undesirable
location, not to be registered.”

Given thatthe lots in question consist of undeveloped lots which are not anticipated to
be utilized by the developer until such time as Fitzsimmons Drive is extended
westerly across lands not owned by 653973 Ontario Ltd. and which would
furthermore require a new pump station due to the change of grade, the request is
considered by the Planning Department to be reasonable.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.
Financial considerations to the City of Brockville would consist ofthe potential for reduced
taxation should reassessments by MPAC occur as expected upon completion of the
deeming process.

CONCLUSION:

ttis appropriate for Council to support the deeming of Part Lot 4 and Lot 135, Registered
Plan 375, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, and for the necessary by-law to be enacted.

Request for Licence to Permit City Clork
A Sidewalk on Broad Street Road Allowance

RECOMMENDED

THAT Council authorize the Mayor and City Clerk to execute a licence agreement with
John Ackerman, Owner, Bud's on the Bay Restaurant for the use of a portion of land on
the east side of Broad Street road allowance for a patio as per the submitted drawing,

PURPOSE

Mr. Ackerman has submitted a proposal for the construction of a patio area on the east side
of Broad Street adjacent to his property.

ANALYSISIOPTIONS

‘An application was submitted by Mr. John Ackerman, Owner, Bud's on the Bay Restaurant,
{or the installation of a patio on the Broad Street. The patio is proposed to be a concrete
slab located between the two entrances, with a metal railing installed to meet the conditions
required for an outdoor liquor licensed area.

Staff are recommending the approval of a license agreement with Mr. Ackerman for the use
of the Broad Street road allowance. The use of the road allowance will not infringe on the
travelled roadway and have litle to no impact on abutting properties. See attached drawing
showing the lands subject to the licence and photos depicting the vision for the patio.

‘The proposal was circulated to the Operations, Environmental Services and Planning
Departments for review and comment. The departments have no objections but did note
that a building permit would be required for the railing and that utllty services are located
near the sidewalk, Included in the agreement is a provision whereby the City would not be
responsible for any costs associated with the patio should it need to be removed to gamer
access to the services for repair and/or replacement or any damage.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

‘There are no financial considerations associated with this report. All costs, including legal,
will be borne by the applicant.

Attached are 2 photos, similar to what | have planned at Buds
on the Bay.

The top photo is a patio similar in size and situated between
the sidewalk and a building.

It also shows plants and umbrellas just as | have imagined.

The 2™ photo shows the type of railing | have planned as well
as the concrete slab that | would pour between the building
and the sidewalk.

A concrete slab is ideal as it would allow me to level it in such a
way to keep water away from the building.

The railing would be removable so not to effect plowing of the
sidewalk in the winter by City crews.

FACADE IMPROVEMENT GRANT (FIG) AND DIRECTOR OF PLANNING

RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL CONVERSION/
REHABILITATION GRANT (RCCR) PROGRAMS.
AND PRIORITY FOR 2015 FUNDING

RECOMMENDED

THAT the program guidelines for the Downtown Community Improvement Plan's
Fagade Improvement Grant Program and Residential or Commercial
Conversion/Rehabilitation Grant Program be reaffirmed with priorty for 2015 funding of
eligible projects to be weighted in favour of rehabilitation or improvements to older
building stock.

PURPOSE

In accordance with Counci's direction during 2015 budget deliberations, this report
provides an opportunity for review of the guidelines for the Downtown Community
Improvement Plan grant programs being funded for 2015, specifically being the
following:

‘+ Facade Improvement Grant Program (CIP-FIG); and
© Residential or Commercial Conversion/Rehabiltation Grant Program (CIP-
RCCR).

BACKGROUND

In April 2004, Council adopted the Downtown Community Improvement Plan (CIP) with
the primary goal of promoting and encouraging commercial revitalization in the
downtown area and the ancillary goal of promoting the construction and rehabilitation of
residential development, and the conversion of upper floor commercial buildings into
residential space.

Three prior amendments have been made to the Downtown CIP, firstly in 2007 to
provide Integration with the newly adopted Brownfields CIP, in 2011, to modify the
boundary of Priority Area No. 1 (137 George St.) and in 2012, following stakeholder
consultation, to introduce the Facade Improvement Grant Program: and Residential or
‘Commercial Conversion/Rehabiliation Grant Program to be available in Priority Area
No.1

‘Schedule “A” to this report illustrates the Community Improvement Project Area, and
Priority Areas under the Downtown CIP.

‘A brief description of the Facade Improvement Grant Program and Residential or
‘Commercial Conversion/Rehabilitation Grant Program is provided below.

Facade Improvement Grant Program (CIP-FIG);

This Program will provide a grant to owners or tenants of buildings who undertake
restoration andlor rehabiltation of Program Area buildings in a fashion consistent with
the original design or with the City's Urban Design Guidelines and the requirements of
the Ontario Building Code.

‘The Fagade Improvement Grant Program offers a grant of up to 50% of the total cost of
fagade Improvements where a project has a value of more than Two Thousand Dollars
($2,000.00), said grant being not more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) per
‘annum, per property, per fagade.

‘All commercial and mixed commercialresidential property located within Priority Area
No. 1 of the Community Improvement Project Area Is the target of this program.

Schedule “B” to this report represents Schedule B-4: Facade Improvement Grant
Program to the CIP Downtown, being the detailed program guidelines and point system
Used to judge eligiblty and for prioritizing of applications.

Residential or Commercial Conver ion Grant Program (CIP-RCCR)

This Program will provide a grant to owners or tenants of buildings who choose to
Upgrade existing space on upper floors to create new or improved residential and/or
‘commercial space in keeping with the original goals of the Downtown CIP.

‘The Residential or Commercial Conversion/Rehabilitation Grant Program provides the
property owner or tenant with a grant equal to 80% of the costs for space converted or
Fehabiltated up to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) per property subject to the
approval of the Planning Department.

‘All commercial and mixed commercialiresidential property located within Priority Area
No. 1 of the Community Improvement Project Area is the target of this program.

‘The detailed program guidelines and point system Schedule B-5: Residential or
Commercial Conversion/Rehabiltation Program have been attached as Schedule "C”.

Implementation

In 2013, Council provided $80,000 to roll out these two (2) new programs. Promotional
material was produced, and information was disseminated to property owners and
businesses in the core area. Funding was committed for six (6) fagade improvement
Projects and two (2) residential conversions for a total of eight (8) projects. There was
no funding allocation in 2014.

Report 2015.039-04 Pages
Downtown CIP Program Guidelines
2015 Funding

ANALYSIS

‘The $50,000 set aside in the 2015 budget will leverage, at a minimum, matching
investment by the private sector for eligible projects and thus will help to achieve the
Downton CIP’s goals of promoting and encouraging commercial revitalization as well
residential development or rehabilitation in Priority Area No. 1.

Staff of the Planning and Economic Development Departments is preparing to trigger
promotion of the Programs, in conjunction with the DBIA, to encourage applications for
2015 projects and uptake of the available funding,

From experience with 2013 funding, it can be reported that the point system developed
for both of these programs is a valuable and necessary tool for determining eligibility
and ranking of projects.

Feedback from Council during 2015 Budget deliberations on some of the outcomes of
the 2013 funding window, however, indicates that further prioritization may be desired
by Council, in order to direct funds towards the older building stock in the Priority Area.

It should be noted that both Programs contain the following stipulation:

“The City, at its sole discretion, will select eligible projects based on the criteria
in this document, including budget availabilty, and other applicable policy and
recommendations. The City is not obligated to fund any project. Precedent wil
‘not influence the City’s decision.”

To beter inform staff responsible for implementing and administering these two (2)
programs that Council wishes to priortize the utilization of available funds, it is
appropriate for Council to make addtional recommendations to supplement the
‘established point systems for the CIP-FIG and CIP-RCCR Programs for this year.

‘The simplest approach to achieve this Is for Council to advise staff by resolution of its
direction that priory for 2015 funding programs is to be directed towards older building
stock in the Prionty Area. Some additional weighting wil then be developed and applied
by staff in review of funding applications received this funding year. This. will not
necessitate any formal amendments to the Downtown CIP's program descriptions and
guidelines.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

‘The Official Plan encourages the use of the Community Improvement provisions of the
Planning Act to prepare Community Improvement Plans. The Downtown area is a
priority for revitalization, and programs such as the Fagade Improvement Grant
Program and Residential and Commercial Conversion/Rehabiltation Grant Program
have been developed to encourage preservation, restoration, rehabilitation and repairs.

‘And Priority for 2015 Funding

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

There are no additional financial considerations at this time as the CIP-FIG and CIP-
RCCR Grant Programs have been approved for funding to the amount of $50,000 for
2016.

CONCLUSION

In large measure, the detailed point system developed under both the Fagade
Improvement Program (CIP-FIG) and Residential and Commercial
Conversion/Rehabilitation Program (CIP-RCCR) and vetted with stakeholders to rank
eligible projects still has merit.

By endorsing the recommendation, Council wil reaffirm the use of the point system, but
will also provide direction for additional weighting to be provided to eligible projects
involving older building stock in the Priority Area,
