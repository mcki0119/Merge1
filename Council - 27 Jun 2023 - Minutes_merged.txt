champions. He has decided for his term as Mayor he will focus Canada Day on
honouring champions. He added that this year is a special milestone for one

Canada Day to pay tribute to his life of service that continues to this day. His
Worship invited and encouraged as many as possible to join them on Court
House Green on Saturday at noon. He noted that the fireworks display will be at
approximately 9:45 pm on the waterfront,

The Mayor explained that this weekend is the annual Hydroplane Regatta,
commencing Friday and finishing up later Sunday. He looks forward to
welcoming thousands of visitors and a wonderful, busy weekend as we truly
move into summer.

His Worship acknowledged the Island Breakfast Committee and the tremendous
dedication and effort towards raising funds to build a pavilion on Refugee Island.
He is happy to see this item on the consent agenda this evening for completion
