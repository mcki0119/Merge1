Discovery Centre project. He noted that he had asked Councillor Journal to
represent the City at the information session given that Councillor Journal sits on the
MDC Steering Committee and due to the Mayor's concerns with the project. The
Mayor indicated that the Recorder and Times story left out his comments indicating
that his concerns did not change the current status of the project; that the City has.
‘an agreement with TSL and if TSL meets the requirements of the said agreement
the City is obligated to move forward. Mayor Henderson noted that the comments
were intended to clarity to the public where the Mayor stands but he continues to
‘see challenges with the current structure. Mayor Henderson indicated that his
‘comments made regarding objectivity were aimed, not at the people behind the
MDC, but the process and structure that have been put in place to create the facility.
Mayor Henderson indicated that he is not trying to “kill the project but remains
uncomfortable with the current format. The Mayor commented that his criticisms of
the MDC represent his own opinions, not the opinion of Council, and that he was
