MAYOR'S REMARKS.

Mayor Wren welcomed Sheena Earl, City Clerk to her first Council meeting. He
noted the absence of Councillor Severson and Councillor Earle and wished
Councillor Severson a Happy Birthday.

Mayor Wren referred to a recent media event to announce that Caber Investments
is in the process of submitting a planning application for the old Woolworth's
building located at 36-46 King Street West. He said a rendering was revealed and
will include two commercial floors, 66 rental apartments, off street indoor parking
and a heritage facade which are all aspects of the community input incorporated
into the redevelopment of this property. He noted the proposed development has
been well received by the community and downtown business owners. A public
meeting is expected early in 2024. Mayor Wren said Caber Investments has
indicated they expect to begin site preparation and demolition in late 2024 with a
two-year construction project to follow. Mayor Wren said the public will be invited
to submit comments.

Mayor Wren noted City staff showcased one of the new Para Transit vehicles this
afternoon in front of City Hall. He said both new vehicles have auto lifts and
adequate head room while being a smaller size which is more conducive to
residents needs. He said staff are fully prepared to begin service in January and
will be reaching out to active users to support them through the transition. Mayor
