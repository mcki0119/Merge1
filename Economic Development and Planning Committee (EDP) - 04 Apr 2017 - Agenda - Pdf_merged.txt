WILDWOOD CRESCENT - PHASE:
HUNTERS HILL SUBDIVISION

OWNER: SPRING VALLEY HOMES LTD.
AGENT: M.VEENSTRA

FILE: 08T-955001(E)

ANALYSIS:

Draft Plan approval for Phase Il and Phase Ill of the Wildwood portion of Hunters Hill
Subdivision was granted on 08 November 20111 (Report 2011-117-11). Condition No. 11 of
the draft approval states that, if final approval of the Plan is not granted within three (3)
‘years of the date of approval of the Draft Plan, and no extensions have been granted, Draft
Plan approval shall lapse. Accordingly, the lapse date was 08 November 2014,

‘The date for Final Approval of the Draft Plan was subsequently extended in 2013 to 08
November 2017. The Applicant has requested that this date be further extended to 08
November 2020 to permit completion of Phase II while retaining the ability to engage in
development of Phase Ill without the need to re-apply for a new draft plan of subdivision.

The Environmental Services Department, Operations Department and Planning
Department have no concerns with extension of draft approval to 08 November 2020.

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:
The applicant is responsible for all costs associated with extension of Draft Plan Approval
to 08 November 2020. The City of Brockville does not have any financial responsibilty
concerning development of the subdivision.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the fore-going information and evaluation, the Planning Department has no
objection to extension of Draft Plan Approval to 08 November 2020,

REPORT TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING COMMITTEE -
04 APRIL 2017

2017-032-04 D. DICK
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SIGN DIRECTOR OF PLANNING (Acting)
BY-LAW 84-89 - ELECTRONIC ANDREW MCGINNIS
MESSAGE BOARD REGULATIONS PLANNER I
RECOMMENDATION:

‘THAT Sign By-law 84-89 be amended respecting the use of electronic message boards
within the City.

PURPOSE:

‘To provide recommendation regarding a general amendment to City of Brockville Sign By-
law 84-89 respecting the implementation of new policies pertaining to Electronic Message
Boards and permitting them within the City of Brockville as an additional advertising option,

BACKGROUND:

(On 07 June 2016 the Economic Development and Planning Committee requested that staff
review Sign By-iaw 64-89 as it pertains to Electronic Message Boards (EMB's) and to
develop provisions to permit this type of signage within the City of Brockville. Currently,
‘Sign By-law 84-89 does not permit EMB's without an amendment o the By-law ata current
application fee of $550.00 (2016 fee) and a processing time of approximately 30 days.

This request was referred to staff due to the increase in Sign By-law Amendment
applications for EMB's that were being received over the last few years and being
presented to Council for approval on multiple occasions. To date, thirteen (13) EMB's have
been approved around the city, nine (9) of which have been since 2012,

ANALYSIS/OPTIONS:

Various sections of the Municipal Act provide municipalities with the authority to pass by-
laws to control signage and other advertising devices. Signs within the City of Brockville
are regulated under City of Brockville By-law 84-89, as amended, known as the “Sign By-
law.

‘The current sign by-law specifically excludes the use of electronic signs under Section 5~
General Regulations Applicable to All Signs in All Zones, Sub-Section §.10 which
states “iluminated or luminous signs of an animated and/or flashing nature shall not be
permitted’, In addition, EMB's are not currently defined under Section 2.0 and the By-law
Contains no regulations relating to EMB's,

Proposed Amendments to Sign By-law 84-69
Electronic Message Board (EMB)

‘Since the intial request by the EPD Committee, Staff has been compiling EMB regulation
information from other comparable municipalities. From the information gathered, Staff
reviewed maximum sign area, location criteria established in each municipality (zones
permitted), colours and timing between transitions of screens. Based on our review, staff
are proposing amendments to City of Brockville Sign By-law 84-89 in order to permit the
Use of EMBs without the need for Council approval of each individual sign provided the
application fits within the specifications of the by-law.

‘The proposed EMB provisions outlined below have been circulated to intemal Departments
for comment, Recommendations from these departments have been incorporated in the
below proposed provisions. Departments that were circulated included the Operations
Department, Environmental Services Department, the Brockvile Police Department,
Brockville Fire Department and the Planning Department - Building Services Division.

In addition to the below recommended amendments, Staff have provided an example of
the maximum size proposed for an EMB, attached as Schedule “A” to this report.
‘Schedule “B" to this report are photos and maximum areas permitted for existing EMBs

that are located around the City which were approved by amendment. Information from
these approvals was used when formulating the proposed by-law provisions.

‘When reviewing the proposed amendments, “Area” is defined as “the number of square
‘metres on the surface of a sign including the border and frame, and where there is no
order shail include all the area of the surface lying within the extremities ofthe sign. In
the case ofa sign having more than one face, the area of the sign shall be the total area of
all sign faces", within Sign By-law 84-89,

Pr yndments to Sign By

Section 2 - Definitions |

Section 2.0 ~ Definitions, of Sign By-law 84-89 does not contain a definition for Electronic
‘Message Boards. The following definition should be added and the subsequent sections. |
renumbered:

New definition for EMB's to read as follows:

“2.15 Electronic Message Board means an illuminated sign or part thereof which
electronically generates and displays letters, words, light pattems, images or shapes
‘o the public in a pre-arranged or variable sequence, and on which the intensity of
the illumination is maintained at a consistent level”.

{In addition to the above, the current definition for a “Flashing Sign’ states that a "Flashing
‘Sign means an illuminated or luminous sign, fixed or rotating, upon which the source of
artificial light is not stationary or the intensity of colour is not constant, but does not include
an automatic changing sign such as time or temperature sign or electrically/electronically

Page 10 of 20,

Proposed Amendments to Sign By-aw 84-89
Electronic Message Board (EMB)

controlled message centro". Staff are recommending that this definition be amended to
remove the reference to the ‘electricaly/electronically controlled message centre” and
replace the reference with “an Electronic Message Board’. The revised definition would
read as follows:

“247 Flashing Sign means an illuminated or luminous sign, fixed or rotating, upon which :
the source of artificial light is not stationary or the intensity of colour is not constant,
but does not include an automatic changing sign such as time or temperature sign
or an Electronic Message Board (EMB).”

Section 5 ~ General Regulations Applicable to all signs in all zones

AAs stated previously in this Report, Section 5.0, Sub-section 5.10 clearly excludes the use |
of electronic message boards by stating “iluminated or luminous signs of an animated

and/or flashing nature shail not be permitted”. City staff are of the opinion that Section 5.0,
Sub-section 5.10 should be removed and replaced withthe folowing provisions pertaining |
to Electronic Message Boards (EMB's) |

“5,10 Electronic Message Board

Electronic Message Boards (EMB's) are permitted tobe incorporated within a fascia
sign, ground sign or standard sign which is lawfuly erected as per provisions
Contained herein based on sign type; and located or displayed subject to the
following:

1no scrolling text or any flashing text, characters, images, or video;

») a maximum of one (1) electronic message board may be permitted per lot or
property;

©) the minimum display time for any electronic message, without movement or
change in colour, shail be 8.0 seconds. |

) _Nooftsite advertising shall be permitted on the EMB;

)_EMB's are not permitted within 15.0 metres of a traffic light/signal:

1) EMB's are not permitted to be used as, or as part of a Portable Sign. j

@)  EMB's are not permitted on a lot containing a building designated under the |

9) EMB sign area shail be considered as part of the maximum permitted sign
area when utlized individually or incorporated in any fascia sign, ground sign
‘or standard sign.”

10.0 square metres (107.6 sq. ft), whichever is lesser, may be used for
the purpose of an EMB;

Section 9 - Signs in Institutional Zones
