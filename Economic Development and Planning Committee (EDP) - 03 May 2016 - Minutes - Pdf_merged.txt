Reticle Proposal for Brockville Airport
Mr. Brant Burrow, Elizabethtown-Kitley Residents Association (EKRA)

Mr. Burrow began by saying he hopes to draw the committee's attention to
a number of issues they (EKRA) have encountered and asked that the
Committee defer their decision tonight

The regular meeting recessed in order to proceed with the public meeting
5:59 pm.

The meeting reconvened at 6:12 pm.

Councillor Deery asked if the City will have any liability should the project
go ahead.

Mr. Casselman responded that the City's Solicitor has been involved
throughout the whole process and has reviewed the lease to protect the
City from liability

Councillor Baker asked if the main problem is the noise or the multiple
outdoor ranges. Mr. Burrows said 2/3 of the problem is the noise factor
and the other 1/3 is the outdoor ranges.

Brockville Airport lease to Reticle Ventures Canada Incorporated
Mr. Geoffrey, General Counsel for Reticle Ventures Canada Incorporated

Mr. Geoffrey provided some clarity into the type of business that will be
operating at the Airport. He stated that they are not setting up an army
base or a paramilitary headquarters. They will be providing professional
training to professional first responders. They will not be training civilians
at this facility.

Mr. Geoffrey stated that they are exceeding all regulations set out by the
Chief Firearms Office,

Mr. Geoffrey introduced his colleague Eric Toupin who is the head of
Project Development. Mr. Toupin stressed that they are trying to bring
economic development to the area. He stated that in the last 12 months
they have spent over $200,000 at local businesses for supplies, $177,000
at the airport alone. He added that in the next 3 to 6 months they will

spend an additional $520,000 at the Tincap location. They currently have 6
full time staff and as they grow local opportunities will arise.

Mr. Geoffrey explained that they won't be able to test noise levels until the
outdoor range is operational. At that time the Ministry of the Environment
will conduct their tests at the facility. If the tests fail, the MOE will shut
down the range. He added that this is a risk they may encounter.

‘The hours of operation were discussed as being 7:30 am to 11:00 pm. Mr.
Cosgrove stated that Elizabethtown-Kitley does not have a noise by-law so
the hours were based on the City’s Noise By-law.

Councillor Blanchard asked what type of firearms will be permitted at the
outdoor range. Mr. Geoffrey responded that they will be 9 mm pistol and a
556 Rifle and occasionally something larger, but they would be required to
use noise suppression.

operation and the type of weapons permitted.
