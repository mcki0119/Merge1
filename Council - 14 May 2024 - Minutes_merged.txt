1. Resolution re: Resuming Property Assessment Cycle

Moved by: Councillor Fullarton

WHEREAS the assessment cycle is an essential process for maintaining the
fairness and predictability of property taxes in our province; and
WHEREAS the pause in the reassessment cycle has created uncertainty

2024, resulting in Ontario's municipalities continuing to calculate property
taxes using 2016 property values; and

WHEREAS both current and outdated assessments are inaccurate, increase
volatility, and are not transparent; and

WHEREAS frequent and accurate reassessments are necessary to stabilize
property taxes and provide predictability for property owners, residents,
and businesses alike; and

WHEREAS the Government has announced a review of the property
assessment and taxation system with a focus on fairness, equity, and

economic competitiveness, and therefore further deferring new property
assessment.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Council of the City of
Brockville hereby calls upon the Premier to promptly resume the
assessment cycle to ensure the stability and predictability of property
taxes while the Government conducts its review of the property
