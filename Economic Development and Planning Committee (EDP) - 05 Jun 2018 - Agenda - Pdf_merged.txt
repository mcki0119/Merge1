REPORT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING COMMITTEE - JUNE 5, 2108

2018-066-06 RNOLAN
MARINA MARKET NEEDS ANALYSIS DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT
RECOMMENDATION

THAT the Economic Development and Planning committee receive for information the
Marina Market Needs Analysis report; and

‘THAT the findings of the report form part of the Waterfront Adhoc Committee's.
‘community consultation on waterfront development initiatives.

PURPOSE

To request Committee to receive the report for information and for the report's findings
to be referred to the Waterfront Adhoc Gommittee for inclusion in their community
consultation,

BACKGROUND

In the past number of years there has been a number of marina's (Ivy Lea, Gananoque,
‘Quinte West) along the St Lawrence and 1000 Islands expanding their operations, and
at the same time there has been anecdotal evidence of boaters bypassing Brockville,
either due to capacity or inappropriate berth size.

‘The City’s waterfront Official Plan objectives identified in the 2008 and 2009 reports,
include:
* To increase capacity for transient guest boating and recreational needs of this
‘market with focus on Quebec/Northern New York
+ To provide the platform for investment attraction targeted at complementary
boaters and tourist services
To increase employment in the tourism and recreational sectors
To utilize innovative mooring designs to address issues associated with
breakwater challenges and limit impact of wave action on boat berthing
‘= To identity innovative financing options for the capital infrastructure and a plan for
investment attraction and financing

In 2016 the City applied for provincial funding under the Tourism Development Fund to
conduct a marina market needs analysis of the City of Brockville municipal marina.

Page 10 of 57
Report - 2018-066-06
Marina Market Needs Analysis

Page 2

The objectives ofthe report were to:

‘+ Assess and validate the market demand for boating traffic along the St Lawrence

+ Todefine the supply of marina services in Brockville and along the St Lawrence

+ To assess the existing Brockville Municipal Marina services in terms of services
for boaters and to identify marketing opportunities

+ To recommend options. for expanding the city's marina operations. to
accommodate future growth and assess their financial operations

+ To identify financing options for capital

In completing the report the consultants undertook the following:
‘+ Reviewed relevant city documents, such as Community Strategic Plan,
Waterfront Master Plan and Urban Design Strategy
Compiled an inventory of marina operations and services;
Conducted a survey of other marina operators along the St Lawrence;
Conducted interviews with 16 local stakeholders, including all local marina
operators

ANALYSIS
The report had a number of key findings, specifically

‘+ The Brockville Municipal Marina has generated a net profit for the City of
Brockuille over the last 8 years of its operation, although this profit has declined
Significant in the last few years, to the point where it is now essentially a break-
even operation.

‘= The marina operation does generate net economic benefit to the community
This is primarily from transient boaters’ expenditures in the City for supplies,
restaurant meals, etc. The analysis undertaken in the report suggests that there
is considerable scope to increase this return.

‘© The boating market is growing at an average rate of 1% to 3% per year. The
survey of operators revealed that some smaller operations were static or even
losing market share while others were growing significantly. Recent expansions
Cf marina operations in Quinte West, were in response to growth in the market,
‘and some marinas in the survey indicated an intention to expand operations in
light of demand growth.

‘= Demand projections for an expanded Brockville Municipal Marina operation over
2 10-year period using the 1% and 3% growth rates were developed. The
projections for a marina in terms of the number of slips demanded in 10 years’
time ranged from 128 to 286 (note that the current provision of slips is 99)

Page 11 of 57
Report ~ 2018-066-06
‘Marina Market Needs Analysis

Page 3

‘+ Two physical scenarios to accommodate this growth were examined: (A)
Improvement of the existing Brockville Municipal Marina with construction of new
secondary facilty east of Blockhouse Island, (B) Brockville Municipal Marina as
transient-only boater destination,

+ Anew and repositioned marina operation has the potential to be profitable: A
high-level analysis was undertaken that suggests that a repositioned marina
‘operation has potential to incur a small loss or make a modest profit. This needs
to be further assessed in a more detailed business plan once a specific scenario
has been selected,

‘+ There is a need for the City of Brockville to more aggressively market and.
promote the City as a key boating destination: The City must be promoted to the
boating community as a ‘must see’ destination, as well as providing a waterfront,
‘and marina that are easy to navigate and access. It is recommended that more
packaging of the Brockville experience for the boater be undertaken as well as
‘more active marketing and promotion.

‘+ The positive economic impact associated with these marina development
initiatives can be significant: The economic impact associated with additional
boating traffic and resulting expenditure in the City is estimated to be between
‘$403,000 and $504,000 at the end of 10 years’ time (as measured in $2018).
This is considerably more than the current level of approximately $150,000.

‘The Report makes six (6) recommendations.

1. Collect more rigorous baseline data from the Brockville Municipal Marina for both
transient as well as seasonal boaters. (end of 2019)

2. Work with the BIA and other key waterfront partners (e.g. the Aquatarium) to
create a product development and marketing strategy specifically aimed at the
transient boater market, (end of 2019)

3. Undertake communications (possibly through a survey) with existing seasonal
slip owners at the municipal marina to apprise them of the investigations into
relocation of the seasonal operation and solicit their input to the planning
process. (2020 - 2022)

4. Similarly, undertake communications with waterfront businesses and other users.
of the waterfront to apprise them of the investigations into relocation of the
seasonal operation and solicit their input to the planning process. (2020 - 2022)

5. Develop a more detailed and specific business plan for the new marina
‘operation. (2020 ~ 2022)

6. Undertake a more detailed design study regarding the development of a
‘seasonal marina operation at St. Lawrence Park and a redevelopment /
refurbishment of the slips in Tunnel Bay. (2023 and beyond)

Executive Summary

‘The following are the key points relating to the market for an expanded marina operation in
Brockville:

The Brockville Municipal Marina historically has generated a modest profit for the
‘municipality: The financial analysis shows that the Brockville Municipal Marina has
‘generated a net profit for the City of Brockville over the last 8 years of ts operation,
although this profit has declined significantly in the last few years, to the point where it
Is now essentially a break-even operation.

2. The marina generates a positive economic impact in the community: In addition to
consistently generating a profit since 2010, there is evidence that the marina operation
does generate net economic benefit to the community. This is primarily from transient
boaters’ expenditures inthe City for supplies, restaurant meals, etc. Thus, the current
‘operation represents a positive ‘return on investment’ to the City, The analysis
Undertaken in the report suggest that there is considerable scope to increase this
return,

3. Recreational boating isa growing market: A survey of marina operators in the Kingston-
to-Cornwall corridor), plus a review of the availabe literature, suggests that on average
the boating market (expressed in terms of demand for both transient and seasonal
boater slips) is growing at an average rate of 1% to 3% per year. While the survey
revealed that some smaller operations were static or even losing market share (as
demonstrated by diminishing demand for slips) others were growing significantly, so
that on average the overall market growth was seen to be within this range. (In fact,
recent expansions of marina operations have occurred in Quinte West, responding to
{growth in the market, and some marinas in the survey indicated an intention to expand
‘operations in light of demand growth.)

4. Demand projection in Brockville has the potential to increase its market share of
boating demand: A demand projection was developed for an expanded Brockuille
‘Municipal Marina operation over a 10-year period. First of all, alow end’ and a ‘high
end’ projection for overall demand throughout the market area was developed, looking
at a 1% and 3% growth rate respectively. Then three scenarios relating to the amount
of this demand that the Brockvlle Marina might be able to capture were developed,
ranging from a continuation of its current market share of about 1.89% to a more
aggressive market penetration rate of 3% which assumed that Brockville was able to
sition itself as a major boating destination on the St. Lawrence, optimally located
between Kingston and Cornwall. The projections for a marina in terms ofthe number of
slips demanded in 10 years’ time ranged from 128 to 286, depending upon the specific
scenario examined (note that the current provision of sips is 99).

5. Two physical scenarios to accommodate this growth were examined:

6. Anew and repositioned marina operation has the potential to be profitable: As with

the capital cost question, it was not a central purpose ofthis study to estimate the
operating costs and revenues, and resulting profitability ofthe repositioned marina
offering. However, a high-level analysis was undertaken. Depending upon the market,
demand scenario, and the physical design configuration selected, the range of revenues
for the various options was seen to be as follows:

Low End Mid-Point High End
Range of Revenues $310,000 $493,000 $676,000
Range of Costs '$376,000 $403,000 $429,000
Net income ($66,000) $80,000 $247,000


Page 17 of 57

roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 5

Clearly, depending upon the specific scenario examined, a repositioned marina
‘operation has potential to incur a small loss or make a modest profit. This needs to be
further assessed in a more detailed business plan once a specific scenario has been
selected,

7. Alloptions assume a much more aggressive stance undertaken by the City of
Brockville to aggressively market and promote the City as a key boating destination:
‘The City must be promoted to the boating community as a ‘must see’ destination, as,
well as providing a waterfront and marina that are easy to navigate and access. Its
recommended that more packaging of the Brockulle experience for the boater be
Undertaken as well as more active marketing and promotion. The kinds of initiatives
that should be considered include:

8. The positive economic impact associated with these marina development initiatives
can be significant: The economic impact associated with additional boating traffic and
resulting expenditure inthe City is estimated to be between $403,000 and $504,000 at.
the end of 10 years’ time (as measured in $2018). This is considerably more than the
current level of approximately $150,000.

‘Recommendation
‘The purpose of this broad and high-level study was to determine whether or not market
demand for boating in the St. Lawrence River appeared to support an expansion of the
Brockville Municipal Marina and, if so, what basic configuration and form an expanded
‘operation would take. It was not intended to be a definitive design study or business case.
Rather, it was understood that if this analysis appeared positive, a number of subsequent
studies would be triggered. The set of recommendations presented here is aligned with that
Understanding. The time frame for recommendations is:

Short-term: undertaken between now and the end of 2019
‘Medium-term: undertaken over the 2020~ 2022 period
Longer-term: undertaken in 2023 and beyond

1, Collect more rigorous baseline data from both transient as well as seasonal boaters. (short
term)

Work with the BIA and other key waterfront partners (e.g. the Aquatariuml to create a
product development and marketing strategy specifically aimed at the transient boater,
market. (short-term)

Undertake communications (possibly through a survey) with existing seasonal slip owners
at the municipal marina to apprise them of the investigations into relocation ofthe
seasonal operation and solicit their input to the planning process. (medium-term)

4. Similarly, undertake communications with waterfront businesses and other users of the
waterfront to apprise them of the investigations into relocation ofthe seasonal operation
and solicit their input to the planning process. (medium-term)

Develop a more detailed and specific business plan forthe new marina operation.
(medium-term)

6. Undertake a more detailed design study regarding the development of a seasonal marina
‘operation at St. Lawrence Park and a redevelopment / refurbishment ofthe slips in Tunnel
Bay. (long-term)

1. Introduction

Brockville isa City of just over 21,000 located on the picturesque shores ofthe St. Lawrence
River approximately halfway between Kingston and Cornwall. Besides boasting a diverse
economic base, itis known as a retirement and tourist community, and prides itself on the
amenities it offers to both residents and visitors. The mst recent statistics from the 2016
Census of Canada reflect the older age skew of the population:

[As the table shows, Brockville is in an area of the province where the population base is older.
Note that the percentage of population aged 65 and older inthe City (over one-quarter of the
population) i significantly higher than the provincial average. The median population of 49.9
Years implies that fully half the population is age SO or above. These general factors are true of
Leeds and Grenville United County as well, although the City is more extreme than the County
inthis regard. (Note that the overall County is growing ata slow pace, as opposed to slight
decline in population inthe City itself.) These demographics are significant to the present study
as older individuals are more likely to be retired and in the phase of life where they are seeking
recreation and enjoyment suited to their age and ability. Boating is one such activity.

‘Added to this isthe fact that the stretch ofthe St. Lawrence River in the Thousand Island area
around Brockville is one of the mostly densely traveled and populated recreation scenic boating
destinations in North America, resulting from its combination of cottagers and local and distant
recreational boaters. The fact of a closely shared international border adds to its uniqueness
and popularity. Its scenic importance is recognized on both sides of the border with
proliferation of State of New York parks on the US side while the Parks Canada (established
11904) and consisting of 21 islands isthe oldest National Park in Canada. The area provides a
Unique visitor experience since itis mainly accessible only by water. It marks where the
Canadian Shield meets the Adirondack Mountains providing spectacular geography and scenic
beauty,

1:1 Purpose and Objectives of this Study
‘The general statement of purpose for the present study is to “undertake a market needs
analysis for an expanded marino and marina services operation, supporting expansion of both
and and water-based tourism recreation program offerings” (page 3 of the Terms of
Reference]. The Project Description then articulates specific abjectives of the marina itself:

‘+ toincrease capacity for transient guest boating and recreational needs of this market;

‘+ toprovide the platform for investment attraction targeted at complementary boaters
and tourist services;

‘+ toincrease employment opportunities in the tourism and recreational sectors;

‘+ to utilize innovative mooring design to address issues associated with breakwater
challenges and limit impact of wave action on boat berthing; and

‘+ to identify financing options for the capital infrastructure and a plan for investment
attraction and financing

‘The determination of market demand, which isthe focus of the present study, isan essential
first step in the move towards an expanded marina operation.

1.2 Activities Undertaken
‘There were a number of activities undertaken in support ofthis project. These included:

‘Thorough review of all background reports and statistics
‘+ Review of other published sources on boating trends
‘Interview program with key stakeholders and interest groups

‘© Benchmarking survey of other marina operations in the market area (Kingston to
Cornwall coreidor)

‘© Meetings with working group and Waterfront Development Committee
Preparation of draft and final reports
+ Presentations

‘The rest ofthe Report presents the integrated findings and recommendations from this,
analysis.

1.3 Overview of Current Marina Facilites in Brockville

Page 21 of 57
°

[At present, there are four marinas operating in Brockville, offering an estimated current and
planned total of 358 slips (348 slips currently exist). The majority ofthese (87%) are seasonal
slips. At present, the Brockville Municipal Harbour (the ‘Brockville Marina’) offers the greatest
‘umber of slips to transient boaters ~ 77% of all current and planned transient slips available in
the City, and just 13% of all current and planned slips.

Marina

Inaddition to the marinas themselves, there is a considerable ‘boating industry’ that has
developed around pleasure boating in Brockville. Some of the support businesses in the Cty

1.4 Overview of Brockuille Marina Operations
Here we provide a brief overview of the current municipal marina operation in terms of the
demand for slips (utlization) and the financial situation of the operation.

Utilization and Revenues: Transient Boaters

‘The trends in utilization of the Brockville Marina over the past 8 years in terms of transient boat
Usage has been gradually downward as the following graph illustrates.

Transient Boaters - Trends in Number of Boats and Nights

Stayed

‘The number of nights stayed per transient boat, on average, has remained fairly constant at
about 1.4. However, estimated capacity utilization has dropped as shown in the chart below. It
should be noted, however, thatthe decline in capacity in 2017 may well have been caused by
the high water levels experienced in the river that year. As will subsequently be shown, this
capacity level is somewhat less than the estimated average capacity utilization for all marinas in
the study area, which is estimated at just about 50%.

Costs and Overall Financial Picture

‘The Brockville Municipal Marina operation has made a profit in every year since 2010, although
the last year (2017) was essentially a break-even year. It should be noted that costs do not
Include depreciation or ongoing maintenance, so the actual contributions may be somewhat
‘more modest. However, were it not for the required remit to the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans (DFO) for the lease of the water lots (20% of gross revenues plus HST) the operation

Page 27 of 57
‘rch Mrna More Demand Stuy CONFIDENTIAL REPORT, 2018 6

would either break even or generate some profit (which would have been approximately
$75,000 in 2010 and $31,000 in 2017). Clearly, the remit to DFO isa significant impediment to
‘Breater profitability for the existing operation.

‘The graph below illustrates these trends in terms of the trends in revenues, costs and net
profitability over the 2010 2017 operating period.

‘The chart below illustrates the cost structure for the marina. As shown, and not surprisingly,
wages and salaries account for the majority of overall costs, although perhaps slightly higher as
a percentage of overall costs than the average for other marina operations (our survey of
‘marinas inthe study area, subsequently discussed, suggested that 39% ofall cost were stafing-
related). In this respect, it should be recognized that the Brockville Marina has relatively high
staffing costs because ofits need to provide enhanced levels of service and security. For
‘example, Blockhouse Island is an open public space and staff are there 24/7 during the summer
to ensure boaters are safe and not disturbing condo residents in Tunnel Bay. (As noted
previously, the costs also exclude depreciation and maintenance). As shown as well on the
chart, and as suggested earlier, the remit to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans also is
responsible for a large percentage of overall costs.

155 Economic Benefits of Current Marina Operation
‘A rough estimate of the economic impact of transient boating in the City of Brockville can be
developed from the following information:

A) data from the City of Brockwille on its marina operation shows that over the 2010-2017
period there were on average 1,134 transient boater-nights sold per year.

8) data from the marina survey undertaken suggests that most operations have no idea what
their transient boaters may spend in their respective communities, but that of those who
do, the average was approximately $190 per transient boater-night. Subtracting the
‘marina fee of approximately $60 per night charged by the Brockville marina leaves
approximately $130 per party per night spent in the community

‘Asacross check on 8) above, itis Interesting to note that the Regional Tourism profile for RTO 9
{the region that includes Brockville) shows that total per person expenditure per night for
pleasure tourists was $154 per person, or (say) $300.0 couple. Subtracting $100 to $150 for
‘accommodation, this would leave on the order of $150 to $200 expenditure per couple per night
{for non-accommedation expenditures such as restaurant, gas, groceries, entertainment, etc
This is in the some general ballpark as the expenditure range we see here - assuming for the
‘moment thot o booting party is ust a couple. (As transient boaters will sleep on their craft, the
‘accommodation portion has been factored out)

"expenditures ot the Morin isef are subtracted to avoid double counting as we wil later compare the ftal
‘expenditure the community tothe deficit incurred by the marina, ond expenditures at the marina by booters
‘contnbute othe sie ofthe deft Le, would be larger if boaters’ expenditures ant offeet io some extent).

Page 29 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 v

‘A 2002 study? of recreational boat spending by boaters and Canadian Power Squad members
fon the Upper St. Lawrence River (Kingston to Cornwall) averaged $165/day/boat, with some
boaters spending considerably higher. Using the CPI, this amount would be equivalent to $212
per boat in 2018 dollars. These amounts excluded expenditures for additional items such as
insurance, boat repairs, marina membership fees, etc.

Ione assumes that when docking in Brockville a couple or family dines at a local restaurant,
buys some clothing, groceries, gas or souvenirs, the expenditures fairly quickly will sum to an
amount over $100. So the $130 per transient boat per night spent in the community is
reasonable. Of course, there is significant averaging going on here ~ for every two families that
spend the night entieely on their boat and not even venture into town, a third will buy a meal,
some clothing, goto the Aquatarium, buy some souvenirs, pick up gas and groceries, and end
Up spending $400 - $500 in a day. (Anecdotally, one local men’s clothing operator spoken to,
cited several experiences from the summer of 2017 when on more than one occasion transient
boaters purchased between $1,000 and $2,000 worth of clothing from the store ina single
transaction.)

‘Accordingly, multiplying A by B suggests total expenditure from transient boaters of
approximately $148,000 in an average season in the community beyond what was spent at the
‘marina itself. Note that this community benefit isin addition to the profit generated to the
‘municipality by the marina operation.

Note that there i likely additional impact from boaters inthe form of expenditure made by
day/weekend/traler boaters who come locally or from a distance and use local boat ramps, but
who do not show up as transient boaters on the river. Thus, depending upon the extent to
Which this isa factor, the above estimates may be conservative,

In future, surveys of transient boaters should be undertaken in order to determine more
precisely what the amount of local community expenditure actually is, as well as current
behaviour patterns and any suggestions for improvements.

1.6 Overall Market Context: Kingston to Cornwall

2. Market Assessment

2.1 General Trends in Boating on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River
‘The interviews undertaken as well as the background materials reviewed have pointed towards
a number of key trends that are at play affecting overall boating on the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence River. (Unless cited otherwise, trends come from those interviewed.) While these
trends generally point to a slowly growing market, several of them have significant implications
for a potential expanded marina operation in Brockville. The trends noted are:

‘* Market Growth: Most ofthe studies and data reviewed point toa slow growth in the
economy coupled with an aging and retiring population, implying some growth in the
overall boating market. Those studies that attempt to quantify this growth estimate it at
between 1% and 4% per year’. At a very broad level, this would imply growth in the
‘overall market for both seasonal and transient boaters slips. Anecdotally, Ivy Lea and
Quinte West marinas have added to their capacity and are reported to be doing well. A
‘number of marinas were impacted negatively by high water levels and flooding this,
spring,

‘Change in the market mix: More novice boaters: Several ofthe marina operator surveys
and some of the interviewees report that asa result of more entrants into the
‘marketplace (i.e. those buying both used and new boats) there are more novice boaters
Inthe boating population. The implications for any new marina operations (or even
existing operations) is to make it as easy as possible for novices to ‘read’ the marina
entrance, in order to know where to go to dock. It has been suggested that there may be
‘a market at some marinas fo a ‘valet service’ to help with or talk over docking operations
for new boaters (and that this may help attract new transient boaters to a community)

‘Change in the market mix: More Francophone boaters: Marina operators along the St.
Lawrence River, in particular, report a change in the market mix. In addition to the ‘more
novices’ factor mentioned above, they report a greater number of Francophone boaters
originating in Quebec. Quebec has a two week “construction holiday” in July which

41) Business Wire: hips //ww businessuire.com/newshome/20180105005329/en/Globo 30.
"ecrestiona-Bostng-Indust-Trends (predicts 3.8% per onaum).

2) growth n US demand: from National Marine Manufocturers Association, which reports that US consumer
‘spending on boats marine products and serces grew by 3X between 2016 and 2017

53) growth in Canedlian demand: from Stats Conado, which shows thot domestic markt demand for
‘rereotanal ating has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8% over the 2011 t 2015 period, wrth some
elements af demand 9 total imports being higher thon that (e..ttalimperts: 46% per annum grouth
‘over same period) (mast recent dota avalble)

4} eur survey of marina operators which basically coroborated the above ranges


Page 33 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 a

attracts boaters to the 1000 Islands area. This clearly has implications in terms of
language facility offered, marketing and promotion, tc

‘= Change in the market mix: Transients from further afield: Several survey respondents
said that they had noticed that transient boaters they were coming from further afield,
Including more ‘loopers’ (Le. those who do a portion of, or the entire loop through the
Great Lakes; down the Atlantic Seaboard through the Inland Coastal Waterway around
Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico; and then up the Mississippi back to the Great Lakes).
This too may have marketing and promotional implications.

‘© Change in the market mix: More families: A couple of operators noted that they were
rnoticing more families with children in the overall boating mix. Again, this could have
implications for the types of amenities and services offered to boaters.

‘© Change in the market mix: More new Canadians: Aithough not mentioned in the
Interviews or the marina survey, ithas been noted elsewhere that the number of new
Canadians becoming interested in boating is increasing’. Many of these new entrants
Into the marketplace are from countries and areas where there isnot an established
‘maritime tradition, and these may represent additional niche market opportunities for
‘marina operations (in terms of providing information, supplies, etc).

‘Clearer waters: It was also noted that the waters ofthe St. Lawrence tended to be clearer
and less polluted than that of other boating destinations in the area (such as the Rideau
Canal and the Ottawa River, which are more susceptible to agricultural runoff and
subsequent eutrophication). The trend here is that these other canals and riverways are
getting worse, so the St. Lawrence River will be increasingly preferred.

«Greater demand for convenience and ease of accessibility: A general increased demand
for services ‘ight atthe dock’ was noted, including restaurants, shopping, gas, showers,
chandlery (boat supplies), etc. While not specifically mentioned, this could include a
convenient shuttle service directly nto the downtown in Brockville’ case. (And there are
‘more imaginative possibiltes to provide enhanced and memorable service. Cobourg, for
‘example, takes unclaimed stolen bicycles, paints them purple, fits them out with oversize
baskets on the handlebars, and makes them available free of charge to transient boaters
toride into the downtown. The ‘purple bikes’ area sign to everyone in town that these
people are boaters and guests tothe town.) Aside from a few B&Bs within walking
distance of the docks, a lack of accommodation in downtown Brockville was noted by the
1000 Islands Tourism Council who felt boaters who wished on-land accommodation
Ideally should not have to find it in the vicinity ofthe 403

‘Short and increasingly uncertain season: The pleasure boating season on the Great Lakes
and the St. Lawrence River has always been relatively short (lly and August), with

* Seo; htp,/hvww.canodboundimmigrontcomyfocus/artilephp?ids1204

Page 34 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 2

hardier souls boating in May / June, and September / October. Some interviewees
suggest that with climate change, there may be a shift in the season and the types of
weather encountered. Some have suggested that the spring season may be less certain
weather-wise, but nicer weather more likely in September, which may shift the season to
some extent more into the fll. All agree, however, that stronger and more unpredictable
storms may be likely. Not surprisingly a key demand factor reflecting this may be that
‘marinas that can offer guaranteed shelter and a suite of ancillary services in time of bad
weather may have an increasing advantage in futur.

‘= Change inthe type of boats: Most operators report that boats are getting longer and
Wider (30 to 50 foot range), which has clear implications in terms of the types of docking
and sip facilities offered at marinas. (20-foot, 25-foot and 30-Foot boats being the most,
‘common ~ the larger size being necessary to house the holding tanks that are now
required for sewage storage on board due to tighter environmental regulations.) Boaters
ln these larger boats are reported to be more affluent and more likely to spend money in
local communities on restaurants and potentially accommodation. In terms ofthe mix
between power and sal craft, it appears as though the current ratio (about 50/50) seems
stable, although one operator observed that salboat owners were ‘much older’ and that
he expected an increasing trend towards power over salln future. The St. Lawrence and
Eastern Ontario are reported to be less sail friendly and are considered more power boat
cruising regions.

‘+ More used boats in the market: According to Canadian boating statistics Canadians are
buying more used boats than new, largely as a result of the punitive exchange rate on
new US-made boats. (For example, in 2016 new boat sales declined by 5.4% while used
boat sales increased by 7%. Overall, just over 100,000 boat sales were made to
Canadians.) If there are more used boats in the Canadian waters, this could have
Implications for boat repair services, replacement parts, etc.

‘Shorter stays in communities: Some marina operators report that their transient boater
quests are staying for shorter periods of time in their respective communities. (While this
‘may be true overall itis noteworthy that Brockville’s average transient stay has remained
relatively constant at 1.4 nights.) In any event, this implies that communities having
‘marinas catering to transient traffic may want to become more aggressive in presenting
activity opportunities and packages to boaters to entice a longer stay and thus greater
‘expenditure in the community)

+ Possible Market opportunities: Possible market opportunities mentioned in an interview
by the 1000 Islands Tourism Council was to promote more to US boaters. There have
bbeen changes to the reporting requirements for entering Canada
(htto://www.gleclub.com/boating-and-uscanada-border) which make it easier for US
boaters to visit Canada. According to the respondent, the Canadian tourism authorities

* See Pars Booting in Canada: itp/boating.ncco/tatshmi#2016

Page 35 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 23

have not marketed cross border travel opportunities as aggressively as they should have.
Le Boat, a houseboat operation starting up in the Rideau Canal may also be an
opportunity if it proves successful. While perhaps not directly related to this project, the
Great Lakes Cruising Coalition believes there is an opportunity for Brockville to participate
‘more actively n attracting cruise ships and believes Centeen Park has sufficient length
and depth to accommodate some of their current fleet.

2.2 Benchmarking: Specific Performance of Marinas in the Study Area
A survey of all 66 marina operations in the Kingston to Cornwall corridor was attempted. In
total, 15 operators responded, representing a response rate of about 23%. This was deemed
quite respectable given the time of year in which the survey was undertaken (December to
February) and the fact that marina operators are notoriously reluctant to share information,

2.3 Market Demand Scenarios

Based upon the information gleaned from the marina survey and the interviews, as well as the
review of background documentation availabe, its possible to develop a forecast of overall
boating demand in the corridor (Step 1), and to determine the share ofthis market demand
that it may be possible for the Brockville Municipal Marina to capture (Step 2),

Page 38 of 57

2.3.1 Step 1: Overall Forecast of Boating Demand in Study Area

‘Avery rough estimate of the amount of demand for boating inthe Kingston-to-Cornwall stretch
of the St. Lawrence River can be estimated through the following procedure:

For Transient Slips

+ at present there are 1,516 transient slips available in the market area

* assuming a 90-day season (with some shoulder season mid-June to the beginning of July,
and from the end of August until mid-September), this implies an upper capacity of
136,200 (rounded) nights

+ weighted estimates from the marina survey imply actual current capacity utilization rates
‘ver the period of an estimated 46% (see Appendix 8)

* this implies approximately 62,500 (rounded) transient user-nights of accommodation over
the period

+ assuming conservative growth in demand of 1% to 3% per annum (see Trends section) over
the coming decade, this would imply a total of 69,000 to 84,000 transient user-nights
demanded by the end of the period

For Seasonal Slips

+ at present there are 5,003 seasonal slips available in the market area

* weighted estimates from the marina survey imply actual current capacity utilization rates
ver the period of an estimated 81%

+ assuming growth at the same rate as with transient boating, the Kingston to Cornwall
‘market area could see a demand for seasonal slips to the end of the coming decade of
between §,530 and 6,720 (rounded) slips

2.3.2 Step 2: Market Demand Scenarios for Brockville Municipal Marina

‘A urvey of matina operators in the Kingston-to-Cornwall corridor, plus a review of the available
literature, suggests that on average the boating market (expressed in terms of demand for both
transient and seasonal boater slips) is growing at an average rate of 1% to 3% annually. This
would suggest that Brockville is losing market share inthe overall market. While the survey
revealed that some smaller operations were static or even losing market share (as
demonstrated in terms of diminishing demand for slips) others were growing significantly, so
that on average the market growth was seen to be within this range. (ln fact, recent
expansions of marina operations have occurred in Quinte West, responding to growth in the
‘market, and some marinas inthe survey indicated an intention to expand operations in ight of
demand growth.)

Page 39 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208

‘The approach taken here is thus to look at two aggregate growth scenarios for boating demand
Inthe entire marketplace: one at the lower end of 19 average annual growth, and one at the
higher end of 3% growth per annum. This forecast thus provides an estimate of the range of
{growth in demand that could reasonably be expected throughout the market area.

Having established the order of magnitude of this aggregate level af demand, the next step is to
determine what share of this demand Brockville in general, and the Brockville Municipal Marina
specifically, might anticipate. The analysis looks at two scenarios in this regard!

1) Continuation of Current Market Share (Demand): The foregoing analysis (see Section 1
of this report) has shown that the Brockville Municipal Marina currently has just under a
296 share of all transient and seasonal boater use in the Kingston — Cornwall corridor
(the shares are actually 2.4% for transient boat-nights’, and 1.3% for seasonal slips)
‘One possible scenario then isto assume continuation of this level of demand
satisfaction (‘market share’) on the part of the marina operation.

2) Become a Boating Destination: A second possible scenario isto imagine that Brockville
positions itself as a major boating destination, optimally located halfway along the
Kingston Cornwall corridor, offering a wide range of activities and opportunities to the
boating public. This scenario envisages downtown Brockville asa focal destination point
for boaters rather than a convenient pass-by location. This scenario envisages —
perhaps conservatively —that the Brockville Municipal Marina might be able to capture
39 of the available market growth,

‘The table below outlines the broad parameters of demand under these assumptions, and the
Implications in terms of the number of slips that might be offered by a repositioned Brockville
‘Municipal Marina. Note that in converting ‘transient boater-nights’ to ‘slips’ we have assumed
the historical capacity utilzation rate of 33%, which isthe estimated average capacity utilization
seen at the Brockville Municipal Marina over the 2010-2017 period. This isa ‘conservative’
approach in that it leads to a higher number of slips being developed. (If, for example, a 50%
capacity utilization assumption was used [which is slightly higher than the average seen across
the corridor forall marinas] the number of slips required would be only two-thirds the numbers
presented below. However, with this lower number of slips, the frequency with which the
‘marina would need to turn away transient boats at peak times would increase.)

Note that lower capacity utilization rates for transient docking than for seasonal docking is
‘normal, as marinas need to provide for peak times (weekends, holidays) to accommodate
spikes in demand at those times.

‘The above table is complex, so a narrative description of how these figures were calculated may
help. Fest, overall demand for both seasonal and transient slips throughout the entire Kingston
to Cornwall area is calculated for two scenarios: a conservative one assuming only 1% annual
demand growth and a more ambitious one assuming 3% annual growth in demand. This yields
estimates of 69,000 transient boater-nights and 5,530 seasonal sips for the entire market area
for the 1% growth scenario, and 84,000 transient boater-nights and 6,720 seasonal slips forthe
entice market area for the 3% growth scenario,

‘Assuming that the Brockuille Municipal Marina is able to retain its current market share of 1.3%
of all seasonal slips throughout the market area, this would imply 72 slips under the 19
scenario and 87 sips under the 3% scenario.

With transient slips, the calculation is slightly more complicated. At present, the projections
throughout the entire market area are for 68,000 transient boater-nights to be demanded
Under the 19 growth scenario, and 84,000 transient boater-nights under the 3% scenario,
‘Assuming a continuation of the current market share for the Brockville Municipal Marina of
2.4% of this demand (as shown above), would imply that the Brockville Municipal Marina would
accommodate between 1,656 (under the 1% scenario) and 2,016 transient boater nights (under
the 3% scenario). However, inorder to determine the number of slips that this would requiee,
itis necessary to determine the reasonable capacity utilization of slips that would
accommodate these boaters. fal slips were occupied entirely throughout the (say) 90-day

Page 41 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 29

season, then atthe lower market growth scenario, only about 18 slips would be required (..
41,656 divided by the 90-day season}. However, obviously, not all transient slips are occupied all
the time. Assuming a one-third capacity utilization rate (which s historically about what we
have seen for transient slips throughout the market area) then 56 slips would be required’. By
the same reasoning, atthe higher 3% growth rate scenario, 68 transient slips would be
required

‘Adding together the seasonal and transient demand figures gives total demand for the
Brockville Municipal Marina of 128 slips under the 1% scenario and 155 slips at the 3% growth

Becoming a Boating Destination

Under this more aggressive scenario, Brockville becomes a significant boating destination withn
the market area, ands able to capture a 3% share of the demand for both transient and
seasonal slips. Under the same logic asin the previous scenario, the demand would be as
follows:

Inthe next section, various ways and means of marketing Brockville more aggressively as 2
‘major boating destination are discussed.

2.4 More Aggressive Marketing of the Brockville Municipal Marina

‘To summarize the current situation: The Brockville Municipal Marina has been faily stable
financially over the period 2010 to 2017. Gross revenues from boaters and related operations
have varied between $200,000 and $240,000, although the trend has been downwards since
2015. While the operation has been profitable, the marina was essentially at break even in
2017, possibly influenced by high water levels last year. A potential concern isa longer term.
decline in transient boater trafic. In this respect, the Brockville marina seems to have been
Lnderperforming other marina operations in the Kingston ~ Cornwall corridor for some time.
Its capacity utilization, while better than some, still appears to be somewhat lower than the
estimated average for other marina operations.

roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 30

‘This analysis, however, shows the overall market to be growing and changing, at an estimated
1% to 3% growth rate annually (on average, even though there will undoubtedly be swings in
demand from one year to the next depending upon weather and economic factors). However,
assuming that Brockuilleis more aggressive in promoting itself to the transient boater market, It
does have the potential to increase its capacity utlization to an ‘average’ performance for
‘marinas overall

‘This improved market positioning could be achieved through a market framing that positioned
Brockville as the go-to (‘must see’) transient boating destination inthe corridor. The focus here
would be on the multi-dimensional experience and various attractions and events that
downtown Brockville could offer to the transient boater. This could have very interesting
‘marketing and product development components:

Concierge service in French, possibly shops & restaurants

other languages as well = Promote easy docking

It must be noted that some of these strategies will have cost implications as well, but these are
‘ot investigated in any detail in this assessment,

A Brockville Marina App

‘The benchmarking assessment revealed that no marinas in Brockville appear to be linked into
standard docking apps that are increasingly being used, especially by new and novice boaters.
While not a central focus of this study, it sa factor that should be considered and incorporated
Into future marina configurations, especially as they will increasingly be critical as a means of
facilitating market access. The standard applications are:

Dockwa: https://dockwa,com/searchlat=44,589524399999098on=-
175.68428588200m=9Barrival=06%2F08%2F2018&departure=06%62F10%2F2018Rdock=tru
This app provides information on slips and services available for transient boaters at
boating locations throughout North America. At present, no Brockville marinas appear to
bbe on the system. This is clearly an area of opportunity for the Brockville Municipal
Marina,

Slipfinder: nttps://www slipfinder.com

Page 43 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 31

This app allows marinas to post slip availability and to adjust price to meet market demand,
‘Again, there i no evidence that any marinas in Brockville take advantage of ths system at
present, but itis assumed that going forward the municipal marina will avail of this system,

In addition, a specific Brockville tourism app could be envisaged that would allow incoming
transient boaters to find out what activities are available, identify and book restaurants in
town, obtain discount coupons, etc. This of course describes a broader app that could be
aimed at any tourist coming into town by any means, but there could be an area on the app
specifically for boaters that would contain information on how to dock, services available,
special activities and promotions, etc.

3. Financial Assessment

3.1 Scenarios for Analysis
‘There are two scenarios that the City of Brockville could contemplate pursuing in terms of
accommodating this additional transient and seasonal demand. These are:

(2) Scenario 1: Improvement of Existing Brockville Municipal Marina and Construction of
"New Facilities East of Blockhouse Island: The analysis suggests that the existing
complement of slips maintained by the Brockville Marina could suffice to accommodate
expected natural market growth in demand for some period of time aver the next,
decade, especially under the lower growth scenario and if capacity utilization could be
Increased. Under this scenario, the existing number of seasonal and transient slips is
‘maintained, although basic improvements are put in place. As slips are replaced, the
sizes of slips would need to be examined to ensure that the mix of facilities provided was
‘accommodating changing tastes and boaters’ needs (presumably to accommodate larger
boat sizes). Possibly the orientation of slips in the north end of Tunnel Bay is turned to an
east-west alignment to facilitate easier docking in light of the prevailing afternoon winds.
The existing culvert across Blockhouse Island from Tunnel Bay to the St. Lawrence River
could be widened to facilitate flow-through in Tunnel Bay to reduce the buildup of algae
and promote the exchange of water.

(2) Scenario 2: Tunnel Bay as Transient Boater Destination: This scenario would involve
relocation of all municipal seasonal boating out of Tunnel Bay; all 82 seasonal slips in the
Brockville Municipal Marina would be relocated to St. Lawrence Park. This would free up
all municipal sips in the current Tunnel Bay for transient boater use. The slips inside
Tunnel Bay could be re-aligned to an east-west orientation to ensure easier boat access
as well as a dockage upgrade and availablity of marina and ancillary services (as
described above). As in Scenario 1, a channel would be opened across Blockhouse
‘sland. Incidentally, another benefit ofthis scenario would be to relocate the profitable
seasonal boating operation to an area outside the Department of Fisheries and Oceans
water lot area, thus saving what the City otherwise would have to remit to DFO (which in
2017 would have been approximately $20,000 ~ .. 20% of the seasonal boating revenue
In that year)

Redevelopment of land east of Buells Creek: Another possible scenarios to dredge out Buells
Creek and a portion of the land on the eastern bank of the Creek opposite the Brockville Yacht
Club, This option has not been examined in detail is it would require acquisition and potentially
land swaps with the current owner ofthis land. The additional water space created on both
sides ofthe creek could be developed into slips for motorboat craft with shallower draws than
sailboats. Itis estimated there could be space for approximately 100 seasonal sips with this
option.

* These scenarios are independent ofthe demand scenario modelling presented in Section 2 of thi report

Page 45 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 33

Note that one complication ofthe situation regarding seasonal slips is that some of the
‘municipal seasonal slips at Ernie Fox Quay are leased to the Tall Ships Landing, which requires
Inaddition to the basic seasonal marina fee, ‘club dues’ to belong tothe fitness club and have
access to other facilites at the Tal Ships development. The avoidance of these additional fees
right cause boaters to avoid these slips thus influencing the estimates here.

‘The advantages and disadvantages of each of these options are summarized in the table below:

3.2 Operating Costs and Revenues

Here we examine operating costs and revenue implications ata very general and preliminary
level

Allcosts and revenues are modeled in terms of $2018. Specific assumptions relating to
revenues and costs for the scenarios looking at three levels of demand are:

Revenues:
* the seasonal boating fee will be Kept at the current level of about $1,700 per slip (on
average)

Page 46 of 57

roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 a

* the transient boater revenue per night will be increased slightly to $70 per boater-night,
reflecting the greater value that a night spent at the Brockville Municipal Marina will

provide
+ revenues from ice and laundry, will remain at the average over the 2010 2017 period,
which was approximately $2.00 per boater-night (and are contained within the assumed

Increase in the transient boater revenue)
* other revenues from leases, and from the concession operations will be 30% of the total
revenues from seasonal and transient sales (which has been a relatively constant ratio.

ver the ast 4 years)

With these assumptions, operating revenues (rounded) under the various demand scenarios
considered are:

‘Market Share sumption 1% growth per annum | 39% growth per annum

costs:
+ current costs are approximately $1,700 per slip (considering all current costs less the DFO

remittance); however, assume that because staffing costs are so large a part of this that
there can be economies of scale that wll bring this costs factor down to 75% of this unit
cost, so $1,300 per slip (rounding up)

* for slips within the DFO remittance area, 19% of slip-elated revenues (the curtent ratio,
recognizing that not all evenues are remittable) will be treated as a cost item

+ seasonal boating capacity is assumed to be at 90% (which reflects the current average at

the marina)
* for scenario (8) involving two locations (i.e. where the seasonal marina operation is moved

tot. Lawrence Park) an additional halftime staff position will be required for
coordination activities (at an assumed cost of $30,000)

Page 47 of 57

With these assumptions, operating costs (rounded) under the various demand scenarios at the
3% market growth level forthe three physical design configurations are:

Range of Revenues and Costs

As the foregoing indicates, and the following table summarizes, there is a wide range of
revenues and costs implied by the various scenarios considered, ranging from the Marina
incurring a smal loss or making a modest profit. A more specific design and operational

scenario would determine where within both ranges the specific operation i likely to fall

low End | _Mid-Point High End
Range of Revenues $310,000 | $493,000 676,000
Range of Costs '$376,000_| $403,000, $429,000
Net income (366,000) | $90,000 $247,000

3.3 Economic Impact Upon the Community
Previously t was estimated that the additional expenditure in Brockville associated with current
transient boaters was on the order of $148,000 annually and that, even though the City’s
existing marina operation was run at a deficit, this represented a good return on investment.
Applying the same logic to future anticipated boating under the three demand scenarios
previously outlined could imply a significant increase to this expenditure. This would result
from two factors:

4) Additional transient boater-nights in the City as a result of marina expansion and more
aggressive marketing; and

2) Greater expenditure per boater as a result of this increased marketing (e.g. more
packaging, greater promotion of what is available, new product development, etc)

Relating to the second point above, the current level of expenditure per boat per night
(excluding what was spent at the marina) was estimated to be $130 per night. If this could be
Increased to $200 per transient boat per night through the initiatives mentioned above, then
the economic impact in terms of additional expenditure associated with each demand scenario
would be:

4. Recommendations and Implementation

4,1 Recommendations

‘The purpose of this broad and high-level study was to determine whether or not market
demand for boating in the St. Lawrence River appeared to support an expansion of the
Brockville Municipal Marina and, if so, what basic configuration and form an expanded
‘operation would take. It was not intended to be a definitive design study or business case.
Rather, it was understood that if this analysis appeared positive, a number of subsequent
studies would be triggered. The set of recommendations presented here is aligned with that
Understanding.

Based upon the foregoing analysis, there are several recommendations to be made to the City
‘These are oriented towards testing the second physical design scenario ("Tunnel Bay as
transient boating hub’) which has a number of compelling advantages over the other
possibilities examined. These are:

+ all transient boating is concentrated in Tunnel Bay, which has the advantage of being close
to the downtown and thus maximizing likely tourist expenditure (this also assumes a
‘more aggressive and proactive stance on the part ofthe BIA and the City with respect to
product development and marketing to this segment); and

+ the more profitable seasonal boating operation (on a per slip basis) is relocated to St.
Lawrence Park, where its outside of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans remit area,
enabling the City to keep all ofthe seasonal boating revenues realized (rather than only
80%)

Recommendations designed to explore further this course of action are as outlined below. In
addition, a suggested timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations is proposed.
‘The general timeframe considered for these is as follows:

Short-term: undertaken between now and the end of 2019
‘Medium-term: undertaken over the 2020~ 2022 period
Longer-term: undertaken in 2023 and beyond

1. Collect more rigorous base line data from both transient as well as seasonal boaters.
‘The current study was hampered to some extent by not having rigorous base line data
(on Brockville boater habits and expenditures. The future planning work envisaged will
require robust information on expenditures, behaviours (e.g. what activities boaters
engaged in, what attractions they visited, etc.) for transient boaters (as well as some
‘more in-depth data pertaining to seasonal boaters). This should be in place so that data
from the 2018 boating season can be collected. (short-term)

Page 50 of 57
roche Morin Meret Demon St, CONFIDENTIAL REPORY, pi 208 38

2. Work with the BIA and other key waterfront partners [e.g the Aquatarlum] to create
a product development and marketing strategy specifically aimed at the transient
boater market. In order to optimize the strategy presented here where transient
boaters are seen to be a strong economic engine to downtown Brockville, a defined
product development and marketing strategy should be developed. Several examples
of initiatives that could be considered (including ‘apps’ that could be incorporated or
developed) have been discussed in this report and should be considered. Note that
even if the marina expansion does not proceed for any reason, it would still be prudent
to develop such a plan. (short-term)

Undertake communications (possibly through a survey) with existing seasonal slip,
‘owners at the municipal marina to apprise them of the investigations into relocation of
the seasonal operation and solicit their input to the planning process. Existing and
potential future seasonal slip holders are key stakeholders inthis new direction and should
be consulted in the planning process. (medium-term)

4. Similarly, undertake communications with waterfront businesses and other users of the
waterfront to apprise them of the investigations into relocation of the seasonal
operation and solicit their input to the planning process. Just as with seasonal si
holders, existing businesses and organizations using the waterfront need to be consulted in
the development of the new plans proposed here. (medium-term)

5. Develop a more detailed and specific business plan for the new marina operation. With
the greater detail resulting from the specific design work that will have been undertaken, a
business plan should be prepared that contains more detailed projections of utilization,
staffing, operating costs, operating revenues, and profitability likely over aS: to 10-year
period. This work should also develop in detail a financing plan for the development.
Council should then base its decision regarding the pursuit ofthe new marina development
‘upon this analysis. (medium-term)

6. Undertake a more detailed design study regarding the development of a seasonal marina
operation at St. Lawrence Park and a redevelopment / refurbishment of the slips in
Tunnel Bay. The next step in exploring this option would be to retain professional design
and engineering expertise to determine the specific configuration for new slip
development at St. Lawrence Park as well as improvements to Tunnel Bay (which would
Include the development of an outflow culvert across Blockhouse Island to improve water
quality in the bay itself). This could be a key element in a more integrated overall
waterfront development plan for the entire area, Ifthe design is for the marina only, the
timeframe should be short-term; itis to be part of a larger and more integrated vision
then the timing will ikely extend into the medium-term. (long-term)

4.2 Potential Sources of Financing
‘The formal infrastructure programs that were available in the past to assist municipalities with
the development of recreational facilites, including marinas, no longer exist. Accordingly, there
are no specifi programs to which the municipality can apply for assistance with the capital
costs of marina development. Despite this, the City should maintain contact with officials at the
Building Canada Fund (overseen by Infrastructure Canada) to ensure that they are apprised of
the project, and the economic benefits that it would bring to the overall region.

Provincially, the Eastern Ontario Development Fund will help support innovative projects of
‘over $500,000 that create jobs and economic impact in communities. Again, there are no
specific ‘marina’ categories in the program, but there is always a chance that a marina project
could be framed as ‘innovative’ and having the potential to create positive economic impact.
(The ‘transient boater focus’ as well as the intent to promote Brockville as the ideal boating
tourism destination could achieve ths result.)

‘The greater likelihood, however, is that the City will need to finance the project through
standard municipal debentures. Since the major facilities in the marina (Le. marina building(s),
docks, and breakwaters [if applicablel) have an expected life that exceeds 25 years it should be
possible to obtain municipal debentures with either a 20 or 25 year amortization period to
cover the projected total capital cost of constructing the marina.

Appendix B - Calculation of Capacity Utilization Rates from Marina
Survey

For Transient Boaters:
‘An estimate of the weighted capacity utilization rate for marinas overall can be calculated from
the survey results by means of the following procedure. Column (a) shows the range of
capacity utilization asked about in the survey. Column (b) shows the number of responses in
the survey indicating that range as thelr response. Column (c) shows the mid-point ofthe range
(assume to be representative of the average response within that range. Finally, column (d)
shows the total number of ‘percentage points’ contributed by that particular category. The
“Total row sums all percentage points forall categories and the ‘Average’ row shows the total
divided by the number of responses: 12. This represents the best estimate of the average for
all marinas responding to this question.

(d)
fa) (b) )
Average for all 12 responses (= Total / 12) 46%

For Seasonal Boaters:
A similar approach was taken to determine the capacity utlization for seasonal boaters using
the survey responses. Note that in ths case there were only 10 marina operations providing
estimates for seasonal boaters:

2. Downtown 7 Waterfront Master Plan and Urban Design Strategy, November 2009,
MMM Group:

In ‘Marinas & Boat Docking’ section
= Endorsed the idea that transient boat docking should be accommodated within,
the DCWA (Downtown and Central Waterfront Area) whereas seasonal docking
was mentioned as being better located in St. Lawrence Park
‘At the time, additional breakwater faclities were not seen as being
economically feasible, but report mentioned that new technologies should be
‘monitored

In ‘Gilbert Marine / Brockville Yacht Club’ section:
Stressed desire to maintain and enhance the range of marine services within
the DCWA currently provided

3. Gity of Brockville Sustainability Plan, October 2012, MMM Group:
No specific mention of ‘marinas’ was made
However, there were several specific elements of the plan that provide positive
context for this work
~ Maintain and improve the City’s docking and mooring facilities at the
hharbourfront
~ Promote the downtown as a destination to key markets within a I-hr. drive
= Develop enhanced amenities downtown

year)

~ Ensure financial sustainability

- Undertake a waterfront public use strategy

= Attract new tourists to Brockuille and make the City @ more diverse place to visit
