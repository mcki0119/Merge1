Executive Summary
Through February and March of 2014, the Southern Ontario Library Service (SOLS)
conducted a survey of library CEO salaries across Ontario, forthe fist time, including
northern libraries. Of the total 315 libraries, 153 completed the survey, representing a
49% participation rate overall

key fining:

‘Over the six years since the last salary survey, the average maximum salary for
{ull time trary CEOs has gone up by 26%, which is more than the 9.7% increase
in the Consumer Price Index.

‘The highest average salaries for full time library CEOs were earned in
‘municipaities with populations greater than 150,000, high operating expenditures
and larger staffs. (Section 1, 2 and 3)

Part-time CEOs generally served populations of 16,000 or less and earned an
average of $26.57%hr. (Section 1)

‘CEOs with additional responsibilities (e.g. for a municipal department) do not
make more on average than their counterparts without additional responsibilties.
Infact, they make 10.12% less than the average maximum salary of full time
respondents. This is a notable difference from the 2008 report, which noted
21.45% higher salaries for respondents with municipal responsibilties. (Section
5)

“The majority of respondents reported a progression from their minimum to
maximum salary by an average of five pre-determined steps. Only nine indicated
that they were eligible for bonuses over their maximum salaries. (Section 6)

‘The majority of CEO salaries were determined by a comparator on municipal
‘grids. (Section 7)

The minimum education level required forthe job in almost half of responses,
was an MLS/MLIS. 20% of respondents indicated EXCEL as a minimum
requirement, up from 12% as assessed in the 2008 report. (Section 8)

‘71% of staff does not workin unionized libraries, compared to 75% as assessed
in the 2008 report. (Section 9)

{69% of CEOs are provided with benefits packages, with the mast common
perquisites being parking and compensating time equal to time worked. (Section
10)

‘The average number of vacation days for ful time staff remains 27, and part time
staff have an average of 19 days. (Section 10)

76% of CEOs reported salaries were adjusted within the last year. (Section 12)
18% of CEOs reported they are currently eligible to retire, with another 17%
Cligibie to retire within 1 to 4 years. (Section 12)

‘+ CEOs of libraries within the Golden Horseshoe region are paid 58% more than
the overall average. The region of Southwestern Ontario is the only other where
‘earnings are above the overall average rather than below.

Introduction
In March 2014 Southern Ontario Library Service (SOLS) libraries and Ontario Library
Service ~ North (OLSN) libraries were invited to complete an online survey regarding
salary and benefits received in 2013. Of the total 315 libraries, 153 completed the
‘survey, yielding a 49% participation rate. Spit into their respective regions, SOLS
libraries had a completion rate close to 63%, and OLN libraries nearly 27%. Of 45 First
Nations libraries within SOLS and OLSN, four responded with a 9% participation rate. A
list of respondents is shown in Appendix A.

Salary surveys of libraries in SOLS were undertaken in 2003 and 2008, comparing
salaries against a numberof factors. The present report repeats the charts in the most
recent 2008 document, including data on benefits, years of service and years to
retirement, comparison between the salaries of CEOs and their highest subordinates,
and any additional functions performed by CEOs, as added in the 2008 report. The most
notable differance isthe inclusion of the OLSN libraries. The inclusion of this data gives
us province:wide context

ae


‘The information collected through the survey gives CEOs a sense of how their
emuneration compares with that oftheir colleagues, considering factors such as budget,
number of staff and branches and so on. The questions about length of service and
projected years to retieement also contribute to other demographic research about the
profession.

Method

Elizabeth Mens, Projects Consultant, was asked to administer and analyze this survey,
mirroring the 2008 and 2003 reports. The survey was distributed electronically to SOLS
‘and OLSN libraries, with a deadline of March 172014. The data requested was for
2013. When responses were unlikely or contradictory the respondent was contacted and
responses verified or amended.

‘The index below divides the findings into sections, which represent the data through a
‘ries of tables and addtional commentary. In the interest of maintaining confidentiality
individual ibcarias are not identified and data is consolidated to reveal overall trends. For
<efintions of terms used in the tables please see Appendix B. Where the total number of
respondents is equal to 153, all espondents have been grouped together. If part ime or
First Nations library CEO information is tabulated separately, i is noted inthe chars.

(Of note: the present report defines full-time as a regular work week of 30 hours oF more,
in accordance with Statistics Canada definitions. This definition differs trom that in the
2008 report, which defined full ime as a regular work week of 35 hours or more.

‘The table below shows maximum salaries organized by population served and broken

First Nations libraries. Fulltime salaries are compared as annual earnings while part:
time and First Nations salaries are compared as hourly wages. Ths isthe only table

this may prove useful for those developing compensation packages for First Nations
library stat.

‘The data below citfers from the corresponding table in the 2008 report as respondents
who were not tiled CEOs are included. These respondents are included because they
were nat noted to have significant aitference in responsibilty according to survey
{questions numbering 10, 11 and 12 (See Appendix C).

‘There is some positive correlation between higher salary and number of ibrary
branches; however, this is not the rule As inthe 2008 report, some CEOS in libraries
with many branches have lower salaries and some with fewer branches have higher
salaries. Township amalgamations and counties that cover broad geographic areas can
‘account for some of the aiscrepancies here.

Section 5

(Of the 153 respondents, 139 (81%) reported their job tile to be "CEO." The remaining
‘9% reported titles including Chief Librarian, Director of Community and Cultural

‘one oF more municipal services in addition to the library. Examples given for aditional

‘Comparison to Highest Paid Subordinate
Participants were asked forthe title and maximum salary oftheir highest paid
‘subordinate. Five reported no paid subordinate staf, while sixteen did not respond. Of
the remaining 132 respondents, common job titles included assistant librarian, assistant
‘CEO, branch head, branch librarian, childrens librarian, deputy CEO, director, head
librarian, and manager. The average maximum salary for subordinates was $24.00
hourly, compared to the CEO average hourly wage of $43.40 who are paid 80.83% more
than their highest paid subordinates. This data is imited by the large variance between
the diferences in salary of subordinates and CEOs. As well, subordinate salaries
reported as annual salaries were converted to hourly wages using the hours worked per
\week of the CEO, which may limit the reliability of this data.
