Goals of Source Water Protection

1. To protect existing and future drinking water sources in
the Cataraqui Source Protection Area

2. Ensure that for every activity that is or would be a
significant drinking water threat, the activity never
becomes significant, or if already taking place prior to
the effective date of the Plan, ceases to be significant

3. Use a precautionary, preventive approach to managing
source protection quality and quantity
