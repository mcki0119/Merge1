Development of new residential land is subject to either dedication of 5% of the total
land area as public parkland or a cashin lieu of parkland payment equal to 5% of the
value of the land determined as of the day before the day of the approval of the draft
Plan of Subdivision. Plan 28M-12 is located within the limits of Plan 380. Plan 380
covers an area significantly larger than Plan 28M-12 and involves a number of separate
developments. At the time that Plan 380 was approved, the owner paid a cash in-lieu
of parkland payment and installed a large fenced, grassed and traditional (slide, swing
set, sandbox, benches), fully equipped children’s play area

1178420 Ontario Ltd., developer for Plan 28M-12, proposed a number of changes to
the children’s play area which was installed under Pan 380. Changes included the
relocation of the play area and park, significant reduction in the play area and park
area, removal of fencing, removal of the original play equipment and benches and
installation of a different play structure.

PURPOSE:

The purpose of this report isto outline vatious items and to provide recommendations as
they relate to the next phase of development within the Brockwoods Subdivision.

BACKGROUND:

(On 40 April 1990, Council for the Corporation of the City of Brockville entered into a
‘Servicing and Development Agreement for development of Brockwoods Subdivision, being
identified as Plan 388. Subsequent Amendments to the Agreement were granted to revise
phasing established within the Servicing and Development Agreement.

To-date, Phase 1, Phase 2A, Phase 2B, Phase 3A and Phase 3B have been built-out.
Phase 4 development is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in
2017. The remaining vacant lands are awaiting extension of roads, sidewalks, municipal
‘servicing and construction of a berm and barrier along the CN right-of-way.

Ownership of lands lying north of Phase 1, Phase 2A, Phase 28, Phase 3A and Phase 38
passed into the hands of the City as a result of tax default. The City attempted to sell the
lands by public sale and achieved the sale of only five (5) lots out of a total of
approximately 110 lots. The remaining lands were subsequently sold in 2006 to a
developer. The current Owner of the majority of the lands is Harbouredge Realty
‘Administration Corporation.

The following lots are held under private ownership: Lots 149, 150, 151, 181, 182, 190, |
206, and Part Lot 190. The proposed amendment to the Servicing and Development |
‘Agreement does not ater the conditions of development applicable to these lots. |

Collett Surveying Ltd., acting as Agent for Harbouredge Realty Administration Corporation,
‘Owner of various undeveloped lands within Plan 388, City of Brockville, County of Leeds,
has made application for the following:

‘+ Amendment to Servicing and Development Agreement to address phasing for
development (Schedule “A-

+ Removal of Part Lot Control from various lots to permit re-alignment of lots
(Schedule “A-2");

‘+ Removal of the H1 and H2 Holding Symbols (Schedule “A-3"); and

Court to the abutting lot owners (Schedule “A-4”),

‘The letters of request have been attached as Schedule “A-1”, Schedule “A-2", Schedule
“A-3” and Schedule “A-4” to this report.

‘The subject lands are located north of Brock Street, immediately east of Centre Street, and
wholly within Brockwoods Subdivision. The subject lands are currently vacant. Schedule
“B" to this report identifies the overall Plan of Subdivision as it was approved in 1990,
being Plan 388.

Collett Surveying Ltd. has indicated that Harbouredge Realty Administration Corporation is
ready to proceed with development of a new phase of Brockwood Subdivision.
‘Accordingly, the following addresses the various requests associated with develoment.

ANALYSI
Amendment to the Servicing and Development Agreement:

‘Amendments tothe original phasing ofthe development are permitted within the Servicing
and Development Agreement with the concurrence of City Council. Accordingly,
amendments to the Servicing and Development Agreement are proposed to address a
change of phasing and a change to the location of the berm and barrier parallel to the
railway as follows:

i) Amend Phasing for Development:

Brockwoods Subdivision has undergone amendment fo phasing in 1994 and 2008 in
Tesponse to requests by developers to accommodate proposed development.
‘Schedule C-1 to this report illustrates the current phasing limits, as amended to 2008,
for Brockwoods Subdivision.

Development of the next phases, being Phase 5, 6 and 7, inclusive, are not consistent
with the approved phasing, as amended. Accordingly, a request has been made for an
amendment to accommodate the next stages of development. The proposed new
phasing is illustrated on Schedule C-2 to this report. The Operations Department,

Environmental Services Department and the Planning Department have reviewed the
proposed phasing and have no objections as it represents logical development of the
subdivision.

il) Amend Railway Berm and Barrier

Brockwoods Subdivision requires the construction ofa safely berm and noise barrier as
follows:

"30. The required safety berm and noise banter to be constructed along the joint
‘boundary of the Plan and the adjacent Canadian National Railway lands,
along with retums of both ends shall be constructed in accordance with
drawings prepared by the offices of Minnes and Thomas Consulting
Engineers dated 89 06 12 and in accordance with recommendations made
by JE. Colter Associates Engineering dated 18 July 1989...”

Due to the elapsed time frame and changes in applicable requirements and legistation,
various alterations are required to be addressed in regard to the design and location of
the required safety berm and noise barrier construction. Said changes are summarized
as follows:

+ Relocate the berm and barrier location approximately 5 metres to the south of
the original approved location. The original location straddled the railway lands
and is no longer acceptable to the railway. The new location brings the berm and
barrier fully on to Harbouredge lands;

‘+ Construction of a storm sewer and associated infrastructure, including the
provision of an easement to CN.

A follow-up study tothe initial acoustical report, issued by J. Coulter Associates on July
18 1989, was undertaken in light of the proposed changes to the required berm and
barrier which resulted in the following conclusion:

“JE. Coulter Associates limited herby confirms that the movernent of the barrier
5 m to the south can be completed without the need to change any of the
recommendations outlined in the acoustic report dated July 18, 1989."

‘as shown in Schedule “D" to this Report.

In addition, a review of the proposed berm and barrier changes has been completed
and agreed in-principle by the Environmental Services Department, subject to a final
review of engineering drawings to include the details of the berm and barrier and a
revised grading plan and a final review by J.E. Coulter Associates Limited following
preparation of a revised grading plan. The Planning Department has reviewed the
proposed changes and is satisfied that the changes in the lots resulting from relocation.
of the berm and barrier do not adversely affect future development under applicable
zone provisions. The developer has also confirmed that development of the lots willbe
undertaken in compliance with applicable zone provisions.

‘The applicant is responsible for preparation of engineering drawings, including a
revised grading plan, addressing the proposed berm and barrier changes.
‘Amendments to various clauses in the Servicing and Development Agreement are
required.

Rem: Phase 5 (Schedul
Removal of Part Lot Control for those lands located within the proposed Phase 5
development would permit re-alignment of various lots resulting in a total of nineteen (19)
residential lots, an increase of one (1) residential lot. The subject lots are described as
Lots 168 to 177, inclusive, and Lots 196 to 203, inclusive, Part of Lots 204 and 208, Parts
of Adley Drive and Dowsley Crescent, City of Brockville, County of Leeds. All lots are to

Tequirements as set out under City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014, as amended.

‘A draft Reference Pian illustrating the subject lands has been prepared and is attached to
this report as Schedule “E”. A final Reference Plan and corresponding deeds will be

The applicant has indicated thatthe ots within the proposed Phase § are expected to be
builtout within three (3) years. Itis appropriate for the by-law to be in effect for a limited
Period of time, and therefore the by-law contains a sunset clause, providing for it to be
effective for five (5) years from the date of ts passing. This allows sufficient ime forthe
dwelling units to be completed and sold

If approved, a By-law shall be prepared to address removal of Part Lot Control for Phase 5

Remove H1, H2 Holding Symbols ~ Phase § (Schedule F):

Removal of the H1 and H2 Holding Symbols for those lands located within the proposed
Phase 5 development would permit development of Phase 5. Said lands being described
as Lots 168 to 177, inclusive, and Lots 196 to 203, inclusive, Part of Lots 204 and 205,
Parts of Adley Drive and Dowsley Crescent, City of Brockville, County of Leeds, Registered

‘The subject lands in Phase 6 are currently zoned as R2-Single Detached Residential Zone. |
‘The R2 zone is preceded by an H1-Holding Symbol and an H2-Holding Symbol. Schedule
“F" to this Report identifies the location of the H1 and H2 Holding Symbols.

‘The *H1- Holding Symbot” refers to the need to ensure servicing is in place or that Council
is satisfied that an appropriate servicing agreement isin place to service the lands.

The *H2-Holding Symbol" refers to the need to install Special Features. In Phase 5, the
applicable special features address conditions set out in the original noise study and |
incorporated into the terms and conditions of the Servicing and Development Agreement. |
In addition, conditions of subdivision approval require that a berm and barrier be |
‘constructed along the common boundary with the CN right-of-way prior to dwelling
‘occupancy. While the requirement for a berm and barrier and for various construction
details will remain in place, the berm has been proposed to be moved approximately 5
‘metres to the south ofthe originally approved location. The proposed relocation has been
addressed previously in this report

Given that the Servicing and Development Agreement is in place, and the berm and
barrier, as amended, will be completed prior to the consideration of issuance of Building
Permits in the proposed Phase §, itis appropriate for Council to remove the "1" Holding

‘Via E-Mail - Re: Brockwoods Subdivision Safety Berm and Noise Barrier Alignment

(Mr. Beshro,

‘As discussed during our phone conversation on September 1, 2016, it is agreed between CN and
HarbourEdge tha the existing restrictive covenant agreement pertaining to the Brockwoods Subdivision,
dated May 14%, 1990, remains in effect. It is further agreed that section 3) ofthe agreement appears to
be contradictory i that it defines the construction ofthe Berm as being parallel and adjacent tothe CN
‘ight of way, however further defines the construction of the Berm in drawings 13 and 14 as being
constructed along the mutval property line such that a portion of the Berm f situated on both
HarbourEdge and CN property.

HarbourEdge isin the process of proceeding with the development ofthe future Phases ofthe
subdivision, which currently have a zoning holding designation assigned tothe lands requiring the
onstruction ofthe Berm and associated Noise Barrer prior to lsuance of occupancy permits. To meet
the requirements to remove the holding designation, HarbourEdge is required to construct the berm
‘and nolse barrier as per the approved agreements and plans, with the following agreed modifications:

‘The earth berm location wil be shifted tothe south a sufficient distance to ensure that with side
slopes not greater than 2.001, the northern toe of slope ofthe berm will be adjacent tothe
‘mutual property ine, and thus situated entiely within HarbourEdge lands. To be clear, this ito
avoid any encroachment onto CN lands durin the construction of the earth Berm. This shift in
location from that shown on drawings 13 and 14 will result inthe sound barrer being a
‘minimum of 5m south ofthe mutual property ine,

‘The exltng plans include provision for an easement across HarbourEdge lands to accommodate
4 storm sewer connection from the CH ral yard, connecting tothe storm sewer on Adley rive

arbourtdge i prepared to construct the storm sewer and associated infrastructure and,
provide the prescribed easement to CN. Its our understanding tat CN doesnot requle the |
extension ofthese services onto CN property at ths time. As sch, the storm sewer between
the CN ralyard and Adley dive willbe constructed along the HarbourEdge lands and capped at
the mutual property ine. This storm sewer wil be connected to the Adley Orie sewer wien

the final phase ofthe development is constrcte, allowing CN to connectin the future if
required

‘Allother provisions within the 1990 agreement willbe adhered to, including the native seed mix
tobe planted along the northern slope facing the CN lands, |

Page 55 of 58

During our conversation, twas also agreed that the 1.83m high chainlink fence along the mutual
property tine, required under the curent CN Principal Main Line Requirement, will be omitted based on
‘the concrete nose barrier having been designed ata minimum 1.83m in height. Upon completion of the
Berm and Noise Barrer, the returns atthe ends willbe reviewed and should it be determined that 9
further barrier to access the CN landss required, a chan ink fence may be installed from the end of the
noise barrier wall othe limits ofthe mutual property line.

| respectfully request you confirm that CN agrees to the above amendments to the terms ofthe
‘agreement currently in place to allow HarbourEdge to proceed with the construction ofthe outined
‘orks and the ultimate iting ofthe zoning holding provision by the City of Brockville.
