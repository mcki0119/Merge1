RECOMMENDATION:

THAT Report 2016-140-11 be received as information and that a report on this matter
be prepared by staff for consideration of the Economic Development Planning
Committee at a future meeting.

PURPOSE

To provide information for purposes of conducting a public meeting under the Planning
‘Act respecting an Application for Amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-
2014 to extend an existing temporary use for a refreshment vehicle for an additional
three (3) years.

BACKGROUND

The subject lands, located on King Street West, adjacent to lands known municipally as
260 King Street West (occupied by the Leon's Furniture Store) are zoned T-MD-1 Mixed
Use Downtown Special Exception Zone and are owned by the McKercher Brothers
Holdings Limited. ‘The owners of the property have authorized Mr. Michael Brewer to
‘submit an application for amendment to City of Brockville Zoning By-law 050-2014 to
extend the special exception zoning on the subject lands. Since 2007, under a special
exception zone, a refreshment vehicle has been permitted as a temporary use on the
subject lands. “Under By-law 097-2013, the most recent extension was granted for a
period of three (3) years ending November 12, 2018. Due to the approaching deadline,
‘the owners of the refreshment vehicle have applied for a further extension of the
‘temporary zone for an additional three (3) year period to allow them to operate at the
current location,

‘The details of the special exception zone, which expires on November 12, 2016, are
attached as Schedule “A” to this report for information purposes.
